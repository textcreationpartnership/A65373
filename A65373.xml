            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And now when theſe Papers, by advice of Faithful and Godly Miniſters, are to be expoſed to publick view, I judged it my duty to pay that Reſpect to Her Graces's Memory, as to prefix your Ladyſhips Name thereunto (which no doubt, if my Huſband were alive, he himſelf would have done) which I the more confidently adventure upon, as that I know your Ladyſhip to be the Lively-portracture of the Graces and Vertues of your Noble, and now Glorified Mother, and to be of ſuch Wiſdom and Prudence, Humility and Self-Denyal, as to excuſe any thing of unſuitableneſs, that may be in this, for one of my Station and Sex. But being unwilling to Allow your Ladyſhip any diverſion from the peruſal of the Book it ſelf, I ſhal only pray, that the Lord may preſerve your Ladyſhip, and carry your hopeful Sons through the hazard of Non-age, and as they are Heirs of two Noble Families, to make them ſhine as Stars of the firſt Magnitude, amongſt the Peers of this Nation; and begs leave to Subſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Shall not detain thee, by expatiating to the commendation of the Author, and this part of his Labours; For the Author, his Memory is ſtill ſavoury, to all who knew him, eſpecially to thoſe of the Shires of <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> where firſt and laſt he exerciſed his Miniſtry; And no wonder, for as he was well verſed in Folemick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, ſo was he a ſingular <hi>Caſuiſt.</hi> He had the Tongue of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon to the Weary; He knew when to Lance, and when to pour in Oyl, when to diſpenſe a Corroſive, and when a Cordial; in a word, he was both a Son of Thunder, and a Son of Conſolation. As for theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> I am hopeful they will commend themſelves, to all who have ſenſes ſpiritually exerciſed, ſuch will not quarrel at the Simplicity and Plainneſs of the Stile, he uſed not in preaching, to put the Scaffold above the Building, no, his deſign was not to tickle the ear, but to reach the heart; had he purpoſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> to the Preſs, and ſurvived to review them, they had been more poliſhed, but now they come out to publick view, as they dropped from his mouth, and as he preached them, without Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or Addition. It is true, many have written both well, and at great length, on this ſweet ſubject; but it is ſo fertile, that it will ſtill afford new matter, to ſuch as arreſt their Spirits, to pore on it; Thou will find here, the <hi>Securities</hi> that the <hi>Covenant</hi> affords, the <hi>Properties</hi> of it, that it is <hi>Everlaſting, Sure</hi> and <hi>Ordered in all things;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Superſtructure, This all my Salvation, and all my deſire;</hi> And the ſweet Harmony and Concord, that is betwixt God's Promiſes, and his Providences, well ſpoken to; But beſides theſe, I ſuppoſe, thou wilt find the duty of Perſonal Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb facs="tcp:43047:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I would earneſtly intreat thee, now when all things earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſo uncertain; to make ſure this <hi>Covenant Relation to God,</hi> that he is thy God, and <hi>thou art His,</hi> by <hi>a perpetual Covenant,</hi> it's a greater Say, to be able to ſay on good ground. <hi>My God;</hi> than to ſay, <hi>My Kingdom;</hi> I have been often affected with ſome ſort of Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the reading the two Teſtimonies that two Heathen Monarchs, gave to the Majeſty of God, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Daniel <hi>2.47.</hi> and <hi>3.28, 29.</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> Daniel <hi>6 26, 27.</hi> But alas! poor Souls none of them could ſay, <hi>My God,</hi> but <hi>the God of Daniel, and of the three Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To perſwade to make ſure Covenant-Relation, know, it's this that gives confidence in our addreſses to God, and that Faith, gets readieſt gripping on, in all thy ſtraits, I ſhall only inſtance three exigencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder outward Toſſings and Preſsures from men, <hi>David 1</hi> Samuel <hi>30.5, 6.</hi> is in great diſtreſs, and no wonder, the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites</hi> had ſpoiled <hi>Ziklag,</hi> had carried away his two wives, and his own men had threatned to ſtone him, in his great diſtreſs, ſo <hi>verſe 6.</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>he encourages himſelf in his God.</hi> When he is in the wilderneſs of <hi>udah,</hi> hounted by <hi>Saul,</hi> Pſal. <hi>63.1.</hi> It's here again refreſhing, <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee;</hi> and when incloſed in the Cave, Pſal. <hi>142.</hi> and <hi>verſe 4.</hi> All refuge fails him, no man cared for his ſoul, this refreſhes him, <hi>v. 5. Thou art my refuge, and my portion, in the land of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Relation is eyed by Faith, and pleaded under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, Pſal. <hi>22.1. My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Pſal. <hi>88.</hi> A pſalm wholly ſpent in ſad complaints, and yet <hi>verſe 1. Heman</hi> begins pleading Covenant-Relation, <hi>O God of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> Iſaiah <hi>49.14. But Zion ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken me;</hi> there unbelief and ſenſe gets the start, but Faith as it were at the ſame breathing eyes this Relation, <hi>My God hath forgotten me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Relation is refreſhing at approaching Death, when the Ciſterns of all created comforts will be broken, and may be, the old Temper turns a keen Accuſer, as in this Text, the matter of the enſuing Sermons, <hi>2</hi> Samuel <hi>23.5. Although my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi>'s houſe was not ſo with God as it ſhould have been; <hi>Amnon</hi> had defiled it with inceſt, and <hi>Abſalom</hi> with unnatural Murther, Rebellion and inceſt, and <hi>David</hi> himſelf with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and Murther, and yet over the belly of this guilt, he can draw comfort from this Covenant-Relation, and venture the weight of his Salvation, on this ſo well <hi>Ordered Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Sure.</hi> I might inſtance moe Caſes, but I ſpare.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43047:4"/>
            <p>It's this Relation that makes all God's Attributes refreſhing to us, He who is a God of Salvation is <hi>My God,</hi> Pſal. <hi>68.20.</hi> and Pſal. <hi>79 9.</hi> The Church pleads for help on this Relation, <hi>Help us, O God of our Salvation:</hi> He who is All-ſufficient, who is Faithful and True, whoſe Mercies exceed all Dimenſions, is <hi>my God;</hi> Yea, it will make his Juſtice, which of all his Artributes, doeth most terrifie a ſinner, under accuſations of guilt, it will make it refreſhing, <hi>He who is Juſt is my God,</hi> and his Juſtice requires not a double ranſom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied in my Cautioner <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, 1</hi> John <hi>1.9. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Sins, He is Faithful and Juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe with an excellent Sentence of Reverend Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> to this purpoſe, and it is this, a perſon who can ſatisfactorily anſwer two Questions, needs never be diſcompoſed in what ever exigency, and the Queſtions are, Quest. <hi>1.</hi> Whoſe art thou? I am Gods by a Covenant-Relation. Queſt. <hi>2.</hi> Where art thou? I am about my Duty. Theſe two were refreſhing to <hi>Paul,</hi> when near to be ſhipwracked, Acts <hi>27.23. The Angel of the Lord, whoſe I am;</hi> There his Covenant-Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>whom I ſerve,</hi> there he is at his duty.</p>
            <p>That He who alone carrieth that title, <hi>The God of all Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> may make theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> refreſhing to thee, is the prayer of</p>

            <p>I Purpoſed this Summer, if the Lord give time, to have handled ſome of Chr'iſts ſelect Names, but have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before I come at them, to handle the Doctrine of the Covenant of Grace; <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25. I ſhal in the entry of it beg of God, that he may be with us, in going thorow the handling of it; and I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt you, as ye would not have his Covenant a Witneſs againſt you, ſeriouſly to ponder, and to feed, by what ye ſhal hear ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about it. I could not find one verſe in all the Bible, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the nature, properties, and effects of the Covenant, were more briefly ſummed up, than in this verſe, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things, and ſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For underſtanding the meaning of the words the firſt verſe of the Chapter tells us, that they were the laſt words of <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſse,</hi> imitating <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49. and <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32. making their Teſtaments, and ſhewing what were their greateſt encouragements when they were dying; he remembers ſome old experience of God toward him, that he was the man whom God had anointed, and lifted up, and made the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſpake by me;</hi> he likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages himſelf in Chriſt, whom he deſcribes in the fourth <hi>v.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43047:5"/>I confeſs there are ſome Interpreters apply the words in the fourth <hi>v.</hi> to Rulers, becauſe of a word in the third <hi>v.</hi> but the current of Interpreters underſtand them of Chriſt, <hi>And he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the Sun riſeth, even a morning without clouds, as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth, by clear ſhining after rain:</hi> a notable ſimilitude, expreſſing the ſweetneſs, brightneſs, and fruitfulneſs of Chriſt, ſo that after he has mentioned theſe two great encouragements in the verſes that we have read, he pitches on that which ſecures all his other encouragements: <hi>David</hi> had a very ſinful houſe, there was murthers in it, and inceſt in it of <hi>Amnon</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> there was adultery in it, and lying, and a number of evils, and when he was a dying, he reflects on what had been in his houſe, and the reſult is, my houſe has not been ſo with God, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting covenant,</hi> &amp;c. Which words, though ſome refer them to Chriſt, who yet was not ſprung out of the root of <hi>Jeſse,</hi> but was to be exhibit in the fulneſs of time, yet I rather take them, as relating to <hi>David</hi>'s perſonal caſe, as ye ſhal hear when I come at it.</p>
            <p>This being briefly the ſcope of the words, I will not be able in the work of this day, to enter on them, or to take them up in particulars: I will only take one general Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the ſcope of the words, and I look on it as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Porch and Introduction to all the Sermons, that are to follow on the Covenant, and of the order and ſureneſs of it, and all the reſt of the ingredients mentioned in the Text. The Obſervation is this, <hi>That one of the greateſt of encouragements at death, and when a man is about his laſt words, is, to have an intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Theſe are the laſt words of the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and there is his greateſt encouragement, <hi>My houſe is not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. Whether we underſtand by houſe, the houſe of his Body, or of his Family, or of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as ſome do, or whether we take it in all the Three, he had grounds of fear from them all, but the great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, when he is ſpeaking his laſt words, is taken from his Intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant: This Obſervation is the very ſcope of the words, when all things are bidding us adieu, and when we are quiting all our Charters, and Lands, and leaving them to others to poſſeſs, an intereſt in the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43047:5"/>Covenant is a great encouragement then; it's remarkable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and two laſt <hi>verſes</hi> of the <hi>chapter, All theſe having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good report through faith, received not the promiſes, God having provided ſome better thing for us:</hi> Mark here now, what was the encouragement of all theſe Cloud of Witneſſes, when they came to die, it was their Faith in the Covenant, they died in Faith, and obtained a good report through Faith, not ha-obtained the Promiſes, but believing it.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this, I will Premiſe two things to make way to the confirming of it. 1. An intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant is of abſolute neceſſity, through the whole courſe of our Life; there are four or five things will evince this. 1. The Covenant is the Light and guide of a Believers Life, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.6. and 7. <hi>v. I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold thy hand, and keep thee, and will give thee for a Covenant to the people, for a light to the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners, and them that ſit in darkneſs, out of the priſon houſe.</hi> Mark how the two go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he is given for a Covenant and a Light; for if it were not upon the account of the Covenant, we would not know how to ſet down one ſtep in our way to God. 2. The Covenant and an intereſt in it, is the door by which we come to know, that we are tranſlated out of nature into a ſtate of grace, therefore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. <hi>Every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my Covenant, them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my houſe of prayer; and their burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted on mine Altar.</hi> And <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to me, that have made a Covenant with me by ſacrifice.</hi> In effect the cloſing with the Covenant is our effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. 3. The Covenant is the Foundation of all the Relations, and Conſequences of all the familiarity grounded on theſe Relations, betwixt God and his People; The ground why we call him <hi>my God, and my hope, my rock, my husband, my Lord,</hi> the ground of all theſe Relations and Familiarity foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them is the Covenant. 4. The Anſwer of all Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, nay of all Temptations, comes alſo from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; Ordinarily Challenges proceed from the Law, and the Threatnings and Curſes of the Law: The beſt anſwer to them is, we are not under the Law, but under Grace, which is in effect to ſay, we are under a Covenant of Grace. <hi>Laſtly,</hi>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43047:6"/>great help to perform Duty is the Covenant, if we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to repent, to pray, to believe, to ſuffer, we muſt always run to ſome Promiſe of the Covenant for ſtrength; and it is remarkable, there is no Command in all the Law, but in the Covenant there is ſome Promiſe relating to that Duty, and ſtrength for performing of it is holden out in the Promiſe; for in effect, if we look after Light, or clearing in our effectual calling, or if we would lay a ſure Foundation, of either an intereſt in, or familiarity with God, or hold off Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or Challenges, or have ſtrength to perform Duties, it's neceſſary in the whole courſe of our Life, that we know our intereſt in the Covenant; but this is eſpecially neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at death: which before I yet confirm, I will add one Caution, which is this; That it may fall out, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with whom God hath made an everlaſting Covenant, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they may be unclear about their intereſt in the Covenant, when they come to die, they cannot ſay among their laſt words, the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant; among many things there may be theſe Three, that may have influence, in the darkning of ones intereſt in the Covenant at Death, and when they are about their laſt words, 1. When one has been given much to doubting in the whole courſe of their Life, readily God may give them, though not a Hell for it, yet he may give them a flood of it at their Death; he loves to write their ſin on the chaſtiſement, therefore often as <hi>Adonibezek</hi> ſaid, when they cauſed to cut off his Thumbs and his great Toes, threeſcore and ten Kings, having their Thumbs and great Toes cut off, gathered their meat under my Table, as I have done, ſays he, ſo hath the Lord required me, <hi>Judges</hi> 1.7. Frequently the ſin of folks Life, he loves to write it on their end; ſo he does with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he deſired to be honoured by him, he hath this ſin among many, he would have all the Males of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> drowned, and <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo was laid out to be drowned, until <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter found him; and what is his end, he is drowned in the red-ſea, the great predominant ſin of his Life is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on his end; when the life is full of doubtings, readily like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he loves to write their ſin on their chaſliſement. 2. One may be darkned about their intereſt in the Covenant at death, becauſe of ſome un-repented guilt, and however that guilt ſhake their intereſt in the Covenant, it may ſhake
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43047:6"/>their clearing about it; often at death it comes to be as it was with <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, when he is giving order to bind them, and they looked for nothing but death, all that is come on us us, ſay they, becauſe we heard not the cry of our Brother. It's obſerved, that we never read a word ſince the day that he was let down into the pit, that any of them was challenged for it, and when they are in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they cannot diſcern <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> to be their Brother, nor can they have any hope from him; the reaſon is, they had not repented for letting him down into the Pit, readily un-repented guilt has great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the doubting of ones intereſt in the Covenant at death; however David was guilty of Murther and Adultery, yet he penned the 51 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and had his bones broken for it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at death he can ſay; the Lord hath made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. One comes to be darkned in their intereſt in the Covenant, when either by Gods providence, or their apprehenſion, there ſeems to be an inconſiſtency with the Promiſes of the Covenant; take for inſtance <hi>Joſiah,</hi> there is a ſpecial Promiſe made to him by <hi>Huldah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, when he ſends to her, after the reading of the Law, (thou ſhalt go to thy grave in peace, before the captivity come on) who would have thought that <hi>Joſiah</hi> would die in Battel, and be killed by <hi>Pharaoh-Necho</hi> in the valley of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddo,</hi> after he had ſuch a Promiſe: Take again for inſtance the fifth Command, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long upon the land, which the Lord thy God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee.</hi> And yet many are taken away in the ſtrength and vigour of their youth, they can hardly reconcile the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the Promiſe, or then it is ſo in their apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; our diſcouraged Spirits at Death, are like theſe that look through black ſpectacles, we miſconſtrue Providence, every thing appears black through theſe Spectacles, while it's white. Now readily one of theſe three, either ſome un-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented guilt, or ſome Providence at Death, that ſeems not to agree with the Promiſe, or the abſolute Soveraignity of God, may produce a great cloud about ones intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when they are at their laſt words; yet notwithſtanding of both theſe Cautions, the point holds firm, that it's a great encouragement at death, eſpecially to be able to aſſert an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the everlaſting Covenant.</p>
            <p>To confirm this in general I will ſpeak a word to theſe three,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43047:7"/>1. I deſire ye may take notice of the Tenor of the Covenant 2. Take a view of the knowledge of an intereſt in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and 3. I ſhal conſider both the Covenant, and an intereſt in it, as tryſting with death, and a Believers laſt words, and theſe three will diſcover what a priviledge an intereſt in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, when it's diſcerned at death. <hi>First,</hi> Take a view brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Tenor of the Covenant, 1. The Covenant is a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction betwixt God and man, about mans greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it concerns his Soul, and that is the choiceſt part of him, it concerns his Eternity, nay the Covenant, as ye will hear, it concerns two Worlds, this preſent World, and that which is to come, for godlineſs has the promiſe of this Life and that which is to come; the Covenant concerns the Soul and the greateſt intereſts of the Soul, it is only theſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, that can reach the Souls intereſt; he was indeed a fool that thought he could tell his Soul good news, on the account he had his Barns full, <hi>Soul, take thee reſt for thou haſt enough laid up for many years.</hi> It was good news to his Ox or his Aſs, but to tell it to his Soul, he was a fool, and the Scripture terms him ſo; for it's only theſe covenanted things that concern the Soul. 2. Take notice, that infinit wiſdom has contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Covenant, to be the only way of Convoyance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, the great intereſt of the Soul, the juſtification of it the Adoption of it, the Sanctification of it, the fellowſhip of it with Jeſus, the glorifying of it eternally, they come in to the Soul no other way but by the Covenant; they that talk of meriting for it, or working for it, or buying of it, they do not underſtand what they ſay; the Covenant holds out the greateſt intereſts, and the only way of attaining them, and coming by them, is in the Covenant way. 3. Not only does this Covenant hold out the greateſt intereſt, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make greater promiſes than he hath made to the Soul, he cannot promiſe greater things than Himſelf, and there is no other way for attaining them, than by the Covenant. So in the third place, The Covenant gives ſufficient ſecurity for them, to ſpeak with reverence, God becomes a Debitor by vertue of his Covenant; I confeſs there are many Divines that ſay, they like not the word, that God ſhould be debitor to Man, they think it below his Glory, and Majeſty, yet they cannot deny, but he is a Debitor in a two-fold ſenſe. 1. He is Debitor to his own faithfulneſs, <hi>If we believe not, yet he abides
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43047:7"/>faithful, he cannot deny himſelf;</hi> it is not ſaid, if we believe not, <hi>he cannot deny us,</hi> but if we believe not, <hi>he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> he is Debitor to himſelf. 2. It's not denyed, but he is Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to Chriſt, for all the Promiſes of the Covenant are firſt made to Chriſt, and through Chriſt they come to be ours, as ye ſaw a man that makes over his inheritance to his Son, and the Son marrying a woman, it comes to be the womans through the Son, ſhe has right to it, becauſe of marrying the man; the Father is principally, if not properly Debitor to Chriſt, for all the promiſes of the Covenant, and he becomes Debitor to us, and our right to them is like the Womans Right, though the Father did not make over the Right firſt, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to her, but to the Son, yet ſhe has a Right to them, becauſe of marrying the Son: ſome may ſcruple at that, he is a Debitor to us, but he is both a Debitor to his faithfulneſs, and to his Son, ſo that our Right to the Promiſes comes to be unqueſtionable, and as fully ſecure, as if God were a Debitor to us; and if he after the promiſes, he muſt both deny himſelf and his Son; and O! what a mercy is it in ſuch a ſtrait as death is, to have the Promiſes in ſo great aſſurance. Now taking up the Covenant in theſe three reſpects, O! what ſpecial encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement muſt it be at death, when all things are bidding us adieu, to have our great intereſt by ſuch a way of conveyance, ſo ſecured, as the Father muſt both deny himſelf and his Son, before our Right to them be contradicted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our priviledge to have an intereſt in the Covenant at death will appear, if ye take notice what the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an intereſt in the Covenant is: I deny not, but there may be an intereſt in the Covenant, God may have made a Covenant with us, and we know not of it, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a priviledge the knowledge of an intereſt in the Covenant is, and I will open this in three things, 1. The knowledge of our intereſt in the Covenant, in that which renders it uſeful for us, in all the comanded Duties of the Law; take for inſtance, if ye be called to believe, or love God, which is the ſum of the Law, the ready way a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath to perform this Duty is to ſearch out ſome Promiſe, and to lay it before God; but unleſs they know their intereſt in the Covenant, with what cheerfulneſs and confidence can they go to the promiſes: I will not ſay, as I find a certain Divine ſay, I thought it a hard word, that a perſon to love
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43047:8"/>Chriſt that is not in Covenant with him, is like a woman lying with another womans huſband, it's a kind of adultery, to love the perſon ye are not in Covenant with; but yet the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to improve the Promiſe, in order to performing duties is, to know the Covenant to be ours, otherwiſe with what confidence and hope, can we plead the promiſe of help in Prayer. 2. The knowledge of our intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is exceeding uſeful to bear off all temptations, the great anſwer to challenges and fears is, we are not under the Law but under Grace; the truth is, as a Divine obſerves, the moſt part of our temptations and challenges, they come from the Law, the threatnings, the curſes, the commands of the Law, but the Tempter brings not our Bond againſt us, he charge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Believer with a Bond, that he is not lyable to, and the great Anſwer we have to them all is, we are not under the Law, but under Grace; that is the way to bear off challenges, when he preſſes with ſuch a Debt, thou haſt broken all the precepts of the Law, and thou art lyable to all the curſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereof; we may Anſwer, thou haſt taken the wrong Bond; for we are not under the Law, but under Grace. 3. The knowledge of our intereſt in the Covenant lets us ſee ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> duty; there are a number of Duties, that we are called to do, that ordinarly we lay quite by, becauſe of the want of the knowledge of our intereſt in the Covenant, ſuch as rejoycing in God, delighting in God, and they are the duties that are likeſt Glory, and yet for all the commands given about them, becauſe of the want of the knowledge of our intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we neither can rejoyce, nor delight in Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That at all times, and in all caſes, the knowledge of our intereſt in the Covenant, is moſt neceſſary at death, when like <hi>David</hi> we come to ſpeak our laſt words; it's true, it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary through the whole courſe of our life, but never more neceſſar than at death, eſpecially if ye take death up under a two-fold formality. (1) Death is the thing that parts us and all other things, a man then quites his inheritance, by death he loſes his legal right to it, ſo that if there were a poſſibility he could come back again, he would find that death had taken away his propriety to it, death has taken away the propriety from Lands, it loſes the relation to the Huſband, to the Wife to the Children; it parts all, a man then muſt give up all his Writs and Lands to another, and his Right to them will be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43047:8"/>as legal as if they were made over by Diſpoſition; O how refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing will this be then, that God ſhal be theirs, and glory theirs. (2) Death, as it diſſolves all unions and relations made for life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, it takes away a mans Right to his Inheritance, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is no more bound by the Marriage covenant to her Huſband, death hath looſed the Contract, ſo death comes as a curſe, it was inflicted in the beginning as a curſe, when God curſed the Man and the Serpent; now a title to this Covenant, makes the thing that was a curſe a bleſſing; it's now, <hi>Bleſsed are they that die in the Lord; and all things are yours, and ye are Chriſts.</hi> (3) Conſider death as it's the March-ſtone betwixt time and eternity, we ſtand as it were on the March-ſtone when we are going to die, we are going from the one in to the other; now a Title to the everlaſting Covenant, when we ſtand on the top of the ſtone, and bids adieu to Sun, and Moon, Huſband, and Wife, to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to Lands, and Poſſeſſions, to bid them all adieu, and claim to an intereſt in the Covenant, and to all the priviledges if it, what a ſpecial encouragement is this? when a man is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Teſtament, he puts in nothing to himſelf, his Lands and Poſſeſſions muſt go to others, or to his friends, and he has nothing to himſelf; it's remarkable, <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he calls all his Children, and gives them all Legacies, when he was making his Teſtament, but he puts in ſomething for himſelf, in one little verſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. <hi>Lord, I have waited for thy ſalvation;</hi> ſo that if ye will take a view of the Covenant, as it contains the great concernments of time and eternity, and what a priviledge it is to have an intereſt in it; he that made us out of nothing, might have commanded us all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he has commanded, and annexed no more, but if ye do not theſe duties, I will eternally damn you, and caſt you in hell, and ye ſhal drink of the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, ſo long as I am God; but ſo condeſcending has grace been, that God hath been content to tranſact thus Covenant-ways, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt ye have this, if any keep my Commandments, he ſhal have my peace, my pardon, nay more, he ſhal have my ſelf, nay more, he ſhal have my Son, and my ſelf for all eternity: now, to have a Title to this everlaſting Covenant, when we are giving up with all our Lands and Poſſeſſions, and death is looſing all Relations, and when we are meeting with that, which is a curſe in it ſelf, then to be able to ſay, <hi>yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

I propoſed this general Obſervation from the ſcope of the words, <hi>That the great encouragement at death, and when we come to ſpeak our laſt words is, an interest in the everlasting Covenant.</hi> I confirmed this from the tenor of the Covenant, the advantages of an intereſt in it, and from the tryſting of theſe two together with the time of death, I will only clear one Queſtion, and ſo apply this point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> It may be Queſtioned, Is not Chriſt the great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Soul, when we come to ſpeak our laſt words and why do we aſcribe this to the Covenant? I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to clear this in the entry of this noble Theme, which I will do with theſe two conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It were a very great injury to take from Chriſt, and give to the Covenant what is his due, all the luſtre of the Covenant is like the Moon that borroweth its light from the Sun, the Moon would be but a dark Planet, except it had light derived from the Sun, ſo all the luſtre and excellency of the Covenant flows from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And I will open here a four-fold reference that Chriſt hath to the Covenant. 1. He was the Purchaſer of it, for as much grace as there is in the Covenant, there is not a promiſe in it, but it is bought, and bought at the full value; how free ſoever it be to us, they were not ſo to our Cautioner, but all the promiſes of Peace, of Pardon, of Sanctification, they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43047:9"/>ſtood him the price of his blood, and ſo he is the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Covenant. 2. He was the Mediator of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he treated it, and in effect drew the Articles of it; the Father when the Covenant was in treating, he knew he had to do with fools, that could not, nor had no skill of their own writ drawing, the Son was the fit perſon concerned in both parties, therefore he has a liberty from the Father, to draw the Articles of the Covenant as he pleaſed, which he did in one of the ſtrangeſt ways, he ſatisfies the Father, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfies us, and it was difficult to ſatisfie both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but he took the difficulty on him, therefore he is called <hi>Heb,</hi> 12. Among the many honourable names he gets in the Bible, he gets this, <hi>Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi> 3. He is the ſurety of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>In ſo much as he was the ſurety of a better Taſtement,</hi> he is the Surety, the Cautioner of a better Covenant; Therefore I will offer two things in reference to this, 1. He is the Cautioner for our part of the Covenant. 2. For the Fathers part of the Covenant, it is well Obſerved by one, he had to do with a party that had three deſects, when he made the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Firſt, that were Dyvors, and not reſponſable, and therefore behoved to have a Cautioner, Secondly, they were witleſs, and had no skill to draw their own Writs, and therefore left it to the Son to draw the Covenant. Thirdly, they were unbelievers, and readily would not take him at his word, therefore he wrote the Covenant in the blood of his Son, and gave him to be Executor of all the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant, and that he had promiſed, and is in a manner Surety for him, therefore ye have Chriſt often tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Diſciples, that they needed not doubt of his Fathers part of the Covenant, for he had given him all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, for performing and accompliſhing the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo he is Surety for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Ye will ask, what hath he under taken for us? I will have occaſion to ſpeak of this afterward, but I will tell you two things he hath undertaken?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1, To get our conſent to the Covenant, <hi>all that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me ſhall come unto me,</hi> that is to ſay, they ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Covenant; indeed this was a great undertaking, and that he may be true to that truſt, he ſends his Word to reveal the Covenant, his Rod to preſſe it, his Spirit to perſwade to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43047:10"/>imbrace it. 2. He has undertaken to pay all our faillings, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Father could not deal with us, for we are Dyvors; and Adam when he was perfect, the Father knew in the ſtate of innocency, what it was to truſt man without a Cautioner; ſo he undertakes to the Father, that we ſhall give our conſent, and for any failling or tranſgreſſion, he ſhall be comptable for it, and it ſhall be on his ſcore.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, he is the Subſtance of the Covenant, he is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the very marh of the Covenant, therefore all the promiſes of the Covenant are nothing elſe but the execution of his three Offices; all the promiſes of pardon, and of peace, are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Prieſtly Office, all the promiſes of teaching and guiding, are the execution of the promiſes of his Prophetical Office; all the promiſes of ruling defending, and ſubduing our enemies, are the execution of his Kingly Office; So all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant, are but Chriſt, repreſenting himſelf as King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church; So to take from Chriſt and aſcribe to the Covenant, would be very injurious to God, for he is the Purchaſer, the Mediator, the Surety, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. Secondly, to Anſwer the Queſtion, the doing of this is no injury to Chriſt, to ſay that when we are at our laſt words, the great encouragement is the Covenant, no more than to abſcribe to the Rayes of Sun, or the pype or conduit that convoyes the water from the fountains, that we are warmed with the Rayes of the Sun, or that we are Quenched by the Water, that comes from the pype; for this derogats nothing either from the Sun nor from the Spring ſo this derogats nothing from Chriſt, to ſay that our great encouragement at death comes from the Covenant, for Chriſt is the Spring, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the Conduit that convoyes the water from the ſpring; and Chriſt is the Sun, and the Covenant is but the Rayes that comes from the Sun, both its heat and its Rayes comes from this Sun? and this is neceſſary in two caſes, 1. To ſhew that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in deſertion when he hides, or withdraws, or frowns, all the Promiſes, and all the Miniſters, nay if Angels ſhould Preach, they will not prove conducible for an outgate, or for ſcattering terrors; the reaſon is, the pype cannot communicat water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spring, and the Rayes cannot communicat heat without the Sun; it's remarkable, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. when the <hi>Shunamites</hi> child died, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſent his ſervant, and his ſtaff, but the child remained dead, untill the Prophet came himſelf: ſo the Covenant, and all the Promiſes abſtracting from Chriſt, if they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43047:10"/>were in the mouth of Angels, cannot be an encouragement, untill he come himſelf, conferences and diſcourſes bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons, convincing reaſons, from the Covenant, from the freedom, from the fullneſs of it, will not bring one from deſertion, untill he come himſelf.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, It's neceſſary to rebuke them, that catch a Promiſe of the Covenant, and will feed upon it, and ſay, they will come to Glory, and God his made a Covenant with them, and God has made Promiſe to them, and yet has no intereſt in Chriſt, it's even as ye ſaw a man coming through a Garden, and he claughts a Branch of an Apple-tree, and he goes and layes it in his Cheſt, and expects he will have Fruit of it in the Spring; But the Branch cannot bring forth Fruit, except it abide in the Root; ſo what we ſay of encouragement among our laſt Words from the Covenant, it derogats not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from Chriſt, more than a man ſhould glory, of ſuch an Apple-tree I plucked Apples, it derogats nothing from the Tree; for abſtract the Branch from the Root, it will bear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaves nor Apple; ſo the poynt holds true, that the only encouragement when we are going to die is from the everlaſting Covenant,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion</hi> 1. I would excit thee O Chriſtian with three Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it, 1. I ask you, is there any thing out of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that ye would have in, or is there any thing in that ye would have out? No, there is not one Syllable; I like the Obſervation ſome has made of the Covenant, if we had been altogether, and had all our heads laid together, there is not one Syllable out that ſhould have been in, and in that ſhould have been out; what is there, what diſeaſe, what condition of Life, if thou were acquaint with the Covenant, that thou would not find aboundantly ſatisfied within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? So that we may ſay of it, as that word, <hi>Song,</hi> 7.13. <hi>At our gates are all manner of pleaſant things, new and old, which I have laid up for my well Beloved.</hi> Some take that as relating to the Covenant, are there not all maner of pleaſant Fruits to be found in the Covenant; but I ask thee, what aileth thee? is there any thing out of that thou would have in, or in that thou would have out? is there any caſe or difficulty but this Covenant will ſatisfie it? why then is your countenance ſad? But <hi>2ly.</hi> Ye will ſay, the Exception runs not againſt the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Covenant, but againſt the freedom of it, there are many conditions in the Covenant, ſay ye; but I tell you, there is no condition in the Covenant, but one, even ſuch as if a Man were going to marry a Woman, and ſhe ſhould ſay, I am poor and has no Tocher-good; he will tell, that ſhall not hinder the marriage; but ſays ſhe, I am black; but am fair, ſays he, and will make the fair through my comlineſs; but ſayes ſhe, I will not marry thee, except thou be content to give me leave to be a whore; the truth is, the Covenant is ſo ordered in the point of freedom, it's not our blackneſs, or poverty, that hinders it; they have no ground to except againſt the marriage, but becauſe the Bridegroom will not give them liberty to be a whore; no, he has drawn it in theſe terms, that all bygones ſhall be by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones, and fair play in times to come; <hi>Thou haſt played the whore with many lovers, and ſee whom thou haſt not layen with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43047:13"/>under every green tree, on every high hill, yet return unto me; let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thought, and he will aboundantly pardon.</hi> But <hi>3ly.</hi> Ye will ſay, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation is houghed without the ſureneſs of the Covenant; I will only ſay this, God may indeed act contrair to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature, and yet not be unfaithful; he may make the iron to ſwim, he may make the moon go back ten degrees, and the Sun ſtand ſtill, he may make the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Fire, not to burn the three Children that were caſt into it; but if he ſhould alter one Article in the Covenant, or not accompliſh one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Covenant of Grace, he behoved ſo deny Himſelf and his Son, for he is become Surety in the Covenant, and all power in Heaven and Earth is committed to him, to execut the Articles of this Covenant; for it's a in a manner written with his Sons Blood, and ſo why go ye with your hands on your Loins, ye that have any Title or intereſt in the Covenant; for it's both Full, Free and Sure.</p>

               </gap> and valid, and muſt be obeyed; it's a ſacred thing to obey the will of the dead, the light of nature has made Heathen tremble, at doing contrair to the will or the dead; the Teſtament is ratified in all the Articles and clauſes of it, by the death of the Teſtator: this is that which renders it exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that the Lord has made the covenant a Teſtament, and ratified it by the death of the Teſtator: So what we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> as a Teſtament in it, that in effect, in a Teſtament there in no more required but to accept the Legacies that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor leaves; it's not like a mans Teſtament, as it is in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Traffick, wherein one binds to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43047:17"/>of them, but that they accept: this makes it of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Teſtament. 3. It has this in it of the nature of a Teſtament, and wherein he exceeds all other Teſtaments, that the Legator leaves Legacies, and he leaves others to give them; but he in the covenant firſt leaves the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and then he gives the Legacies; it's remarkable when he is about to die, he calls his Diſciples, and tells them he is going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he behoved to die there; It was in his fare-well Sermon, and they were much againſt his going and he tells them, I will leave you a Legacy, <hi>My Peace I leave you,</hi> and he puts in the things that never man did put in any of a Teſtament and <hi>My peace I give you</hi> ſo that it has the nature of a Teſtament in it, conſiſting of Legacies. 4. It has this of a Teſtament, which is alſo ſingular, it's not ordinary in Teſtaments, (Lawyers obſerve that both the Law of Nature, and all other Laws have made againſt it) that men ſhould diſpoſe of an Inheritance by Legacies and Teſtament; the reaſon is, becauſe they think folk when they are dying, are not ſo compoſed, therefore the wronging of Heirs comes to be excepted in diſpoſing of Inheritances; but in this Teſtament, it's not Peace, or Pardon, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, that he leaves only, but it's a Teſtament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he Communicats the Inheritance, without wronging of the Heir; So it has ſomething of a Teſtament in it, it takes in Inheritance as well as Moveables, and ſo it's formally a Teſtament, and therefore the Spirit of God, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Interpreters on the Scrptures thought fit, to call the Scrptures, the Old and New Teſtament, the ſame on the matter with the Old and New Covenant; but I pitch on the name of Teſtament, as it were to ſhew his latter will, both to ſhew what Curſes he leaves, and what Bleſſings he leaves, and the way how to get the one, and eſhew the other; they are confirmed by the Death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nay the Heir is rather glorified by the Teſtament, though it take in the Inheritance.</p>

            <p>Firſt, underſtand what is left you, I will tell you two things which the Teſtament bears, it bears tokens and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, and it bears an inheritance; his peace, his joy, his conſolation, are indeed moveable and very alterable things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the Teſtament bears likewiſe an Heritage; for the Law may be diſpenſed with in Chriſt; the reaſon why Juriſts will not admit of a dying perſon to diſpoſe of inheritance at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43047:18"/>Death, they ſuppoſe they will be roving, and their ſickneſs is diſtempering them: but this cannot be ſuppoſed in Chriſt, therefore his Teſtament bears firſt tokens, and moveables, and then an Inheritance; now the way to know if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament bear you to the inheritance is, Firſt, to know if the Teſtament bear you to the tokens and movables, it bears you to his Pardon, his Peace, his Repentance, and Grief for Sin, they are moveables indeed; But if ye be in the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Such Moveables, ye are likewiſe in the Teſtament for the Inheritance; It's Remarkable his Teſtament is not made up of Bleſſings only, but alſo of Curſes, there are many curſes contained in his Teſtament, and ſome get no more in the Teſtament, but like ſome deboiſht Children, when the Father has called them together to make his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he gives one his Bleſſing, and a ſecond his Bleſſing, and a third is fallen in Adultery, and he gives him his Curſe, <hi>Jacob</hi> has it ſo in his Teſtament, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> brethren in evil, curſed be &amp;c.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay but it is not ſo in Chriſts Teſtament, ye muſt take heed that ye do not Confirm it by Law, the reaſon of it is, Chriſt hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it himſelf, for Chriſt to prevent this when he made the Teſtament, ſaid, <hi>my peace I leave you;</hi> But ſome will ſay, he may leave his Peance to us, but we will not get it. until it be Confirmed by Law, no, <hi>my peace I give you;</hi> when a thing is both left and given, it needs no Confirmation; there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gets Legacies left them, and they muſt have them Confirmed by Law, but we need no Confirmation of the thing that is given, ſo that any that gets a part of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, whether it be of the Moveables, or a Title to the Inheritance, if they queſtion it, until they get it Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, they do not know the nature of this Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for there needs no more, ſince he both leaves and gives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> In reference to this Name of the Covenant, as it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Teſtament, I would give you this direction, that ye may have a part of his Teſtament, conſider to whom the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43047:19"/>in the Teſtament are left, ſometimes in the Teſtament they are ſpoken of as folks that were of kin to Chriſt, they are called his <hi>brethren,</hi> his <hi>ſiſters,</hi> his <hi>friends;</hi> ſometimes in the Teſtament they are ſpoken of as folks, that <hi>he loved to converſe with,</hi> I ſay unto you my friends, fear them not that can kill the body, and can do no more, &amp;c. ſometimes they are ſpoken of in the Teſtament, as folk that the Father had <hi>given him;</hi> they have many Names in the Teſtament, there are ſome but babes, ſome young men, ſome fathers; now I would have you take the Teſtament in the full latitude of it, if ye would feed comfortably on it, whether ye be in kin, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be Brethren, or Siſters, or in any near Relation, if ye cannot find your Names in the Teſtament under that Notion, go &amp; enquire if there be any friendſhip betwixt you, tho ye be not in Kin, yet folk will leave Legacies to their friends, if none of theſe will hold, try if ye be babes, or young men, there uſes not to be much Friendſhip betwixt wiſe men and babes, yet babes may be in the Teſtament, for the Teſtator may have Kindneſs to them on the account of ſome Relation; lay all theſe Names together, to whom the Legacies are left, and if ye find ye have not been a Friend, Try if ye be of Kin if none of theſe will hold, Try if ye be Babes; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him all power in Heaven and Earth, and it muſt be a rich Teſtament he leaves, and to have a Right to it we ſhould labour to ſhufle our ſelves in among them that have a Right to this Teſtament; many would ſhufle themſelves out of this Teſtament, ye ſhould rather conſider what a rich Heir he was that made the Teſtament, and try all the Qualifications and Deſignations of the perſons to whom the Legacies are left. To be breif, it's a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſenſe of the whole Covenant, that it is a Teſtament, for it ſtands ratified by the Death of the Teſtator, and if the Father alter any thing of the Covenant, he will alter the will of the Dead, which looks not like Him. This is the firſt name given to the Covenant, it's a Teſtament ratified by the Death of the Teſtator, and they have a ſecure Legacie, that has an Intereſt in the Teſtament, we need not pay for it, for they were not Legacies if we behoved to buy them, we have our Right to them not by Price, but by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>

That at that time, ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-walth of <hi>Iſreal,</hi> and ſtrangers from the <hi>Covenants of Promiſe;</hi> So we will find it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:16. and 17. <hi>verſes,</hi> twice called a <hi>Promiſe;</hi> and ye will find it frequently get this Name in Scripture, this Name is a Promiſe added to a Teſtament, is very conſiderable; and there are two things that I will ſpeak a little to here, <hi>First,</hi> Why the Covenant is called a Promiſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What encouragement a Believer may have, from calling it a Promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt:</hi> Firſt, Why is the Covenant called a Promiſe? There are three or four Reaſons, why the Covenant is called a Promiſe, one of them relates to God, 2 <hi>2d.</hi> to the Covenant, and a third to Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, In reference to God, a Promiſe it's an Act of Dominion, a man that makes a Promiſe, he hath the thing he promiſes under his Command, or elſe he promiſes fooliſhly. <hi>2ly.</hi> A Promiſe It's an Act of Condeſcendency, he that is content to make a Promiſe, condeſcends to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and deſire of them to whom he makes it. <hi>3ly.</hi> A Promiſe is an Act of Liberality; but the main thing here, a Promiſe is an Obligation, it brings a ty on the Perſon that makes it:</p>
            <p>Now the truth is, the Covenant is all the Four, in regard of God, it's an Act of his Dominion, of his condeſcendency of his Liberality, and it brings an Obligation on him; but theſe are not the ſpecial Reaſons, why it come to be called a Promiſe, the ſpecial Reaſons are from the nature of the Covenant, and the nature of the Covenant has two things in it, that makes it properly to be called a Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The great things in it are Promiſes, it was not ſo with the Covenant of Works, the great things in it were Commands, and therefore ye find it often called in the Bible a <hi>Law,</hi> the Covenant of Works will be called the Law, for the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it was to give commands, but it is not ſo with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, it's not Law and commands; that is not the ſpecial deſign in it, but it's Grace and Promiſes <hi>2ly.</hi> It comes to be called a Promiſe, in regard there is no Command in it all, but there is a promiſe of ſtrength to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; ye ſee me ſometime at Examining, putting you to this, there is no Duty in all the Covenant, but there is a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43047:20"/>Promiſe relating to that Duty; and if ye remember the Obſervation ye heard the laſt day at Examining, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an has never a call to a Command, but in that call, he has a call to the Promiſe; When we are commanded to obey, to do, or to ſuffer, Chriſt never calls us to a Duty in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but he calls us likewiſe to a Promiſe of it, whether it be to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rayer, Repentance, Believing, Loving of Chriſt, or Suffering for Him; So that it comes to be no wonder, that is to be called a Promiſe; for in effect, there is nothing required in all the Covenant, but it's promiſed; Suppoſe there were a man that ſhould bid another man come to his Shop, and buy ſuch a piece of Cloth, and in the mean time ſhould round in his Ear, I will give thee Money to buy it, even as much as the price of it will come to; that is rather a giving than a ſelling; we indeed buy in the Covenant of Grace, but it's without Money and without price, and any thing that we part with for the Covenant it is but that which would undo us; as if ye ſaw a Woman that has a Child, that hath gotten a Knife in his hand, and ſhe is fear'd it undo the Child, ſhe will go and Treat with the Child, <hi>I</hi> will give this Apple, and this preaſant thing, and that, providing thou wilt quite the knife ſhe is afraid the Child cut his fingers with the knife, or undo himſelf with it, and the Child will not quite it without buying it; the Goſpel drives ſuch a bargain as this; for in the Covenant of Grace, all that God does in the point of Command is only that we quite the knife that would cut our fing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, and He will give us all the Apples, and pleaſant things contained in the Covenant, ſo it's no wonder it be called Promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> It's called a Promiſe in regard of us, there are two things in regard of us, that makes it be called a Promiſe, and the <hi>antinomians</hi> will have it called by no other name, they deny it to be a proper Covenant, they ſay it's only a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but it's in regard of us called a Promiſe, on thir two accounts (1) Becauſe we have contributed nothing to the procuring of the Covenant, but it's allanerly of Grace; as if a man were ſending to his nighbours houſe for ſomething he has payed for, he might ſend for it, and readily crave it as a debt; but when he ſends for any thing promiſed, he muſt not go exactly, and obſerve all the paſſages of craving it, he had no right to it but by a Promiſe, many a time
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43047:20"/>when God gives not his people that fulneſs of peace of joy, of conſolation, that readily they would have, they ſit down and quarrel, as readily the thing they would have were payed for; but thy right to it was but by Promiſe, And a giving thing ſhould not be looked in the mouth, <hi>2ly.</hi> It comes to be called a Promiſe, in regard of us, in reſpect the thing we do in the condition of the Covenant, it's no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the thing promiſed; there are great things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and we have no Influence on it; What would all our ſervice do to influence this Promiſe, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone?</hi> What did we contribute, when we firſt bargained with him, did we not reſiſt the Promiſe, did we not ſay, <hi>I will go after my lovers?</hi> What warnings did we ſit out, before we brought our neck under his yoke? All theſe prove that the Covenant is a Promiſe.</p>
            <p>And from this Name of the Covenant, I would have you notice three or four things, before I go further; Is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant called a Promiſe? Then, 1. Miſtake not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ye will hear preſently, it has another Name nor a Promiſe, as if it were no way conſiſtent with the Law, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> ſay ſo, it's a conditional Promiſe, go not ye to take up the Covenant, as if it were only a Promiſe, and had no condition at all: I deny not, but there are abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in it; I will ſpeak of them afterward. But, <hi>2ly.</hi> Here the great encouragement, that Believers have for their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they are under a Covenant, the Name whereof is a Promiſe: Suppoſe one of you were drowned in deſertion, and a ſecond exceedingly weak, and ſuppoſe a third were reproached and deſpicable; yet if ye have from one that has both power and faithfulneſs; a promiſe, that is refreſhing; if one ſhould ask a man that were in great debt, how will ye win out of it? I have a Promiſe, ſays he, ye have no pith nor power to pay your debt, I have a promiſe from one tht is rich, that can pay it; here is the great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Believers have, and they have no other thing to keep up their heart, but only this, I have a Promiſe. <hi>3ly. I</hi> marke it for this end that I may put thee to the thing I was preſſing the laſt day, to take it up as a Covenant of Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; what am I? ſays one, my houſe is not ſo with God, what an I? ſays another, I have a croſſed life in this world. But will any of theſe hinder him from making a Promiſe?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43047:21"/>Thy Charter is not Merit, thy Charter and mine is not Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, but allanerly Promiſe; and the only expectation we can have of wearing the Crown, and walking in the City that hath the twelve Gates, is allanerly Promiſe. If Satan and our deceitful heart queſtion thy right, and ſay, thou deſerves Hell, and thou haſt many marks of going to it; yet if thou have a Promiſe, and a Title to the man that gives the Contract, and draws the Articles of it, thou may be very ſure, thy Covenant is a Covenant of Promiſe, that is the ſecond Name. The third Name that is given the Covenant, it's called a <hi>Command;</hi> ye have it getting this Name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Abraham is commanded to circumciſe,</hi> in the tenth <hi>verſe, every male child among them, this is my Covenant which ſhal be betwixt me and you, and thy ſeed after thee, every male among you ſhall be circumciſed, and ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your foreskine:</hi> If ye compare this with the 13 and 14 <hi>verſes, He that is born in thy houſe, and bought with thy money, ſhall be circumciſed, and my Covenant ſhall be an everlaſting Covenant and the uncircumciſed man-child, whoſe fleſh is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off,</hi> he has broken my Covenant, that is, my Command: Here ye have the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, called under the Name of a Command: And here I would enquire a little into two things, <hi>1ſt,</hi> Why the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant goes under the name of a Command? <hi>2ly,</hi> How we ſhould improve this Name of the Covenant as a Command;</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, It goes under the name of a <hi>Command, He has broken my Covenant,</hi> that is, my Command, on theſe two grounds; <hi>1.</hi> The Covenant of Grace, it does not only oblige to all the Commands of the Covenant of Works, but to ſome moe, this may ſeem a ſtrange aſſertion; there is no Command in all the Law, but the Covenant of Grace binds to it, <hi>I came not,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil the Law, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, thou ſhalt not ſteal, thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours goods,</hi> &amp;c. The Covenant binds to all theſe, and to many moe, it binds to Faith in Chriſt, to Repentance, which the Covenant of Works did not; ſo no wonder it be called a Command: for this Covenant binds to all the Duties commanded in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and to many moe. <hi>2ly,</hi> It comes to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of a Command, it was the ſame Covenant of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43047:21"/>Grace that <hi>Abraham</hi> had a ſeal of in Circumciſion; it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a command in regard never were perſons ſo obliged to obey the command, as theſe that are taken within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace: The taking of us within the Covenant of Grace, is like a Woman Married, that is more obliged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uncleanneſs, than ſhe was before her Marriage, the relation is in Chriſt, the influences are from Chriſt. The perſons under the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay, they are not ſo bound to the command as others; but they miſtake it quite, if any perſon be bound in the world to the command, it's they that are not bound by the Law only, but by Love; the caſe is as it was with <hi>Moſes</hi> Mother, <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter calls her when ſhe found <hi>Moſes</hi> among the Flags, and commanded her to Nurſe the Child; the beſt Motive that moved her to nurſe the Child was Love, ſhe ſtood by to ſee the Child among the Flags, and when ſhe took up the Child, Love influenced her as much as the Law; So, when there is a Covenant relation to Chriſt, the perſon in Covenant has an eye to him, not only from the command, but from Love; So that no wonder it be called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for it has all the commands of the Law, and ſome moe, and the obligations to obey, are ſtricter than under the Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But here is a great Queſtion, ye ſay the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is a Covenant of Works; we love to hear Grace exalted, and called a Teſtament, and a Promiſe, but that it ſhould be called a command, looks this like a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, it's called a command, and it binds to all the Duties that the Covenant of Works binds to, and a great many moe, it binds to Believing in Chriſt, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which the Covenant of Works had no dream of; but this takes nothing away from the freedom of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hearken to two or three remarkable things about the command, and it will ſhew you, that though it be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the command takes nothing away of the freedom of it. 1. Take notice, that though it have ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as many as in the Covenant of Works, and moe, yet it will not ſtand on perfect obedience to them, ſincere obedience it's one of the clauſes of it, and O! but it's a ſweet word, He will accept of the Will in ſtead of the Deed:

So ye have heard of the Covenant of Grace, and of the three Names given to it, that are handled this day, it's a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and a <hi>Command;</hi> but the Name I eſpecially deſigned to handle is, the calling of it a <hi>Covenant.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. From all the work of the day, learn the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Works; if ye be out of the ſtate of Nature, and can prove your effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, and that God has wrought a work of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within you I know no tempation, nor diſcouragement, that needs to afflict you with the fear of Hell; make but ſure under what Covenant ye are, and that God has indeed brought you to be born again, and ſtated you under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, the Glory ye look for, how ſimple, how low, how guilty ſoever ye be, it's left to you as a Legacy in Chriſt's Teſtament, and the Father will not control the will of the Dead: If thou can come to be ſtated under a right Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thou needs not fear to plead as a Dept of Juſtice, Lord, give me thy Peace, and thy Pardon; If thou ſhould ſay, I am ſimple, poor, and ignorant, but will theſe make excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the things left in Teſtament by Chriſt?

            <p>There are three things that properly make up a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and all the three concur in this covenant; Firſt, there are parties indenturing, and treating, and concluding together. 2.

               </gap> of other Nations, therefore Princes will enter into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43047:25"/>of Traffique, and exchange Commodities with other, by exporting or importing them; Now the Covenant of Grace is a Covenant of Traffique and Commerce with Heaven, and therefore ye have ſometimes a Believer called a Merchant, <hi>The wiſe Merchant goes and ſells all that he hath, and buyes the Field where the Pearl is:</hi> And ye have Chriſt himſelf holden out in the Scripture, under the formality of a Merchant, <hi>Come, buy Wine and Milk and Honey, without Money, and without price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing this formality of the Covenant, as it's a Covenant of <hi>Traffique,</hi> I would have you to notice three or four things. 1. That Man as he violats the covenant of Works, he came under enmity againſt God, and the Covenant of Peace was broken up, ſo that by that Fall all Traffique with Heaven was broken up, to this day the natural Man has no kind of Merchandiſing or Traffiquing with Jeſus, readily he may come to Ordinances, and to the Mercat of the Goſpel, but he has no Traffique with Chriſt, his Covenant admits of none, there is neither buying nor ſelling betwixt Chriſt and him; but the opening or this everlaſting Covenant, and getting an Intereſt in it, opens a Traffique betwixt Chriſt and Believers, and ye will find in the Covenant theſe three or four things relating to this Traffique.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Ye will find the goods we traffique for, holden out in the Covenant, and they are of many kinds, there is <hi>wine, milk, honey, ſpices, gold, oyl, fine linen, eye-ſalve,</hi> in effect there are fields, and fields wherein the Pearls are, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant offers, and opens a traffique, a commerce, a trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and Believers, and the things are <hi>Wine, Milk, Honey,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Ye have the Covenant not only opening the things for which the traffique is about, but ye have the price of them in the Covenant, ye have a treaty about the price of the Commodities, Iſaiah 55. <hi>ye that have no money, come, and buy without money, and without price;</hi> this ſeems to be a contradiction, to buy without money, and without price; How can that be? the truth is, our buying is a kind of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the merchants part, I confeſs it's a conſiderable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that ſome move, How can it be ſaid, that theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are ſold without money, doeth not the wiſe merchant ſell all, and goes and buyes the field where the Pearl is, can he be ſaid to buy without money, and without price, that ſells all and gives for the field? But the truth is, our all is not money, <hi>but droſs and dung, and when we have done all, we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43047:26"/>are but unprofitable ſervants;</hi> and when we have ſold all, and bought the field, we have neither given money nor gold for it. 3. There is in this traffique on this formality, under which the Covenant is taken up, there is this Clauſe I ſay, in the Articles of Traffique, that the whole Stock, on which we Trade, is Chriſts, and we come to Traffique with a nothing mans goods; It's remarkable, there are ſome he ſends out and gives them but one Tablent to Traffique with, others he ſends out and gives them two, to another he gives three, to another he gives four, but whether they be one, three, or four Talents, they are all his, all the things one which the Believer Traffiques, according to the Terms of the Goſpel covenant, they are all his, the glory and grace of it; no wonder they ſhould eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially redound to him; ſo that when we have done any thing, or when we have gone and Traffiqued at a Communion, and Traded in Prayer; or when we have gone to a Sacrament, or a Promiſe, whatever the Traffique be, it's always Chriſts Stock on which we Trade, The Talents are his, and not ours, the parts, the gifts, the graces, the liberty in Prayer, the enlargement of Heart in performing Duties, they were all Chriſts, the Talents were his, and we were only Traffiquent with another mans goods: ſo when we have moſt liberty, and make the beſt Mercat we can, the gain and glory ſhould eſpecially and principally redound to him. 4. In a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Commerce and Traffique, there uſes to be gain deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if it be not attained, the Merchant thinks all that he, hath done loſt labour; this is indeed in the Covenant of Grace, as it's Covenant of Traffique, the perſon that has ſkill to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Trade, is deſigning gain; it's true there are many bunglers and hypocrites, that has no ſkill to follow the Trade, but he that has ſkill to Trade, his two Talents becomes four, and his five comes to be ten; it's neceſſary for them that are under this Covenant of Traffique, to be every year obſerving how their Stock grows, whether it be increaſing, or going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whether thou be more heavenly, more Spiritual, more Tender, or whether thou haſt more Communion with God for the Covenant is a Covenant of Merchandiſe: for if we be ſtanding ſtill, we are going back, if we be at a ſtand with it, and has no more this year than the laſt year, thou has the ſame meaſure of Duties, the ſame meaſure of Grace, the ſame meaſure of Knowledge and of Words, thou his no ſkill o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:43047:26"/>the Trade, if thou be not thriving and gaining at it; ſo ye ſee it's firſt a Covenant of Peace and War, next it's a Covenant of Traffique; labour to make uſe of the Covenant, not only for Peace, but for Friendſhip with him; in the Contrivement and drawing of the Covenant, he deſigned a Traffique and Trade betwixt him and thee, and deſigned gain in it, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine therefore how it thrives with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Covenant as it's a Covenant that uſes to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Princes and Subject, betwixt Maſters and Servants, it's called a <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Covenant, under this formality it's neceſſar to be taken up alſo, as a Covenant betwixt Superior and Inferior; now that it is ſuch a Covenant, it's evident, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard frequently it's called a Command, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.9. <hi>He has commanded his covenant for ever.</hi> That ye may take it up under this formality, I would have you notice three or four things, that occurs in this Covenant, all of which ye will find meeting in the Covenant of Grace. 1. Ordinarly, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the Superior Indentures with the Servant for ſeveral things, the Servant according to the nature of his ſtation is to perform his part of his Service; every one that comes under a Covenant, are not called to the ſame ſervice, the Maſter will have one to wait on his own perſon, another to hold the plough, a third to call the plough, yet all come under a <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Covenant with the Maſter; thus it is in the Covenant of Grace, the great Lord and Mediator has Treated the Covenant ſo, as every Chriſtian that enters in Covenant, though he be not bound to all the Work of other Servants, yet he becomes particularly bound to all the work of the Station, and of the calling, to which by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he is called; readily he is not bound to the work of an Officer, but to the work of a more privat ſtation; but all the Duties of his ſtation, the Covenant binds him to them; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the ſtation thou art in, whether thou be a Merchant, or a Maſter, or a Servant, or a Friend, whatever be the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or relation, God in the Covenant has bound thee to, all the Duties of that ſtation, both in reference to thy Maſter, and all thy fellow-ſervants; ſo that when we wrong our neighbour, let it be in his name, or in his Poſſeſſion, we fall under a breach of one Article of the Covenant, ſo though the Covenant bind firſt and principally the Maſter to the Servant, coming under the <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Covenant, and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43047:27"/>Servant he is eſpecially bound to the Maſter, yet when he is under that <hi>Deſpotick</hi> covenant, the Maſter will not allow the Servant to ſtrike his fellow-Servants, but he is bound in his carriage to be at Peace with others; ſo in this <hi>Deſpotick</hi>-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, it binds firſt, <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our ſoul,</hi> and alſo <hi>to love our neighbour as our ſelves;</hi> ſo the injuries done to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are a breach of the Covenant with God. 2. In a <hi>Deſpitick</hi>-covenant, we have not only ſervice Required, but it's ordinary for Maſters to tell the Servants the manner of the ſervice, he will have them to do it humbly and obediently, and readily; now in the Covenant of Grace, as the Father has enjoyned all the Duites of the ſtation of the Servant, he takes in Covenant, ſo be hath told the manner how it muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he tells it muſt be performed ſincerely, and in faith, and with an eye to Chriſt, and from a Principle of Love to God, and to the Glory of his Maſter; or elſe he tells us in the Covenant, he will regard it no more, <hi>than the cutring off a dogs neck,</hi> or as if he had killed a man; ſo when we do the duties of our ſtation, if we do them not with the qualifications required in the Covenant, we break the Covenant. O how many breaches are we guilty of, when we are ſo little at our Duty; when we engaged in the ſervice, we engaged to do it ſeincerely and ſpiritully, that it's not done in Love, Faith, and in the right Goſpel Motive, we break the Covenant; no wonder many Believers go with their hand on their loins, for breach of his Laws, when both the Duties of the ſtation are negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; or if they be done, they are not done according to the qualifications required. 3. In doing this ſervice there is a Reward, promiſed on the Maſters part to the Servant, the Lord of that Servant when eh cometh, verily I ſay unto you, the Maſter ſhall make him Lord over all that he hath; nay more, the Lord of that Servant ſhal gird himſelf, and ſtand and ſerve him; ſo that in effect in this Covenant, as the Covenant binds to the Duties of the ſtation, and that they ſhould be done in ſuch and ſuch a manner; ſo there is a great Reward promiſed to them that do them. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Sometimes liberal Maſters in making Covenants with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will give them ſome Arles, ſomething in hand; ſo we read in Scripture of the Earneſt of the Spirit, that is, in our beginnings, the Arles of the Spirit, the beginnings of Love,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43047:27"/>of life, of Liverty, of Peace with God, of delight in God, they are like a Maſter, that he may encourage the Servant to do the Work he hath commanded him; not only he promiſes to give him a Reward, but to give him all that he hath, and will give him an Earneſt of that; It's remarkable, Princes that intend to be liveral in their Offers, which they make, as <hi>Herod</hi> did to <hi>Herodias,</hi> they have ſaid, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give it thee, to the half of my kingdom:</hi> never one offered to give them all that he had, and to make them Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over all that he had; ſo ye ſee the Tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, under all theſe three Formalities, but all theſe three hold not out the nature of it ſo fully, as the fourth, it's a Marriage Covenant, it's a Covenant Tranſacted, not only quing together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is a Marriage Covenant, and that beſt expreſſes the nature of it.</p>

            <p>AMong many Differences betwixt the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace, this is one; there is no Promiſe in the Covenant of Works, but there are four Commands for it, but there is no Command in the Covenant of Grace, but it hath two Promiſes, there is a promiſe of ſtrength to obey, and a promiſe of Reward when it is obeyed; Therefore no wonder it be called a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Promiſes: I told you that there were four ſorts of Covenants among men, and the Covenant of Grace was a Complex of all the four, it had ſomething of the nature of a Covenant of <hi>Peace and War,</hi> it has ſomething of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Covenant of <hi>Traffique and Commerce,</hi> it's a <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Covenant, ſuch as betwixt Maſter and Servant, and Prince and Subjects; but the truth is, all theſe three do not fully
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43047:28"/>expreſs the nature of it; therefore the fourth which remain a little to be ſpoken to, will open it more fully, it's a <hi>Marriage. covenant,</hi> therefore ye find very frequently in Scripture, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eſpouſals, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, as a chaſt virgin to one husband, even to Jeſus Chriſt, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee the kindneſs of thy youth, even of thy eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals;</hi> herein it differs from the Covenant of Works, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Works was <hi>foedus amicitiae,</hi> God and <hi>Adam</hi> were friends; but this is <hi>foedus conjugale,</hi> a Marriage-covenant.</p>
            <p>That I may the better open this formality of the Covenant, as a Marriage-covenant, I will offer theſe two things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. 1. I will ſhew you, that this Covenant eſtabliſheth a Marriage betwixt Chriſt and Believers, it's in effect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and contains all the Articles of the Marriage. 2. I will ſhew you on what grounds it comes to paſs, that this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Covenant eſtabliſheth this Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this Covenant drives at a Marriage, it's not a Covenant of Peace and War only, or a Covenant of Traffique, ſuch as betwixt Kings and Subjects, but it's a Marriage-covenant, The clearing of this will appear, if ye notice two things that uſe to Conſtitute a Marriage, and the Covenant eſtabliſhed them both with Chriſt. 1. There is an Union, a Marriage Union. 2. There is a Communion that flows from that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Union, theſe are the two things that effentially conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Marriage, and by the Covenant both the two come to be eſtabliſhed, betwixt Chriſt and Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is an Union, I mean not an Union of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or that is founded in the relation betwixt King and Subject, or Maſter and Servant, but it's a Marriage Union there are two properties accompanying a Marriage Union <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's the neareſt Union. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's the ſtrongeſt Union. 1. The Union betwixt Chriſt and Believers, is the neareſt Union, it's remarkable, it's compared in Scripture to the Union, betwix the root and the Branches, the Head and the Body, the Huſband and the Wiſe, they are ſo U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, that of all Unions it's the neareſt; Chriſt ſpeaking of theſe that were unite to him, hath a ſtrange word, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. and alſt <hi>verſes, For who ever ſhall do the will of my Father, the ſame is my brother, and ſiſter, and mother.</hi> How can theſe conſiſt together, to be his brother, hsi ſiſter, and mother? But the meaning is, they have the neareſt tyes to him, the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43047:28"/>neareſt Union, he is as near to me, as if he were my brother, my ſiſter, and mother. 2. As it's the neareſt Union, ſo it is the ſtrongeſt; the Marriage Union is of all Unions the ſtrongeſt; but this Union with Jeſus Chriſt, eſtabliſhed by the Covenant, it has ſomething ſtronger than the ordinary Marriage Union: For 1. An ordinary Marriage Union may be looſed by Adultery; It's not ſo in this Covenant, <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return tome, back-ſſiding children, for I ma married to you.</hi> 2. An ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Marriage Union may be diſſolved by death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.2. <hi>The woman which hath an husband, is bound by the Law to her husband, as long as he liveth, but if her husband be dead, ſhe is looſed from the Law of her husband:</hi> but neither Adultery, nor Death, can looſe this Marriage Union; ſo the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant eſtabliſhes an Union with Jeſus, not meerly of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Traffique and Commerce; but it eſtabliſhes a Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Marriage Union.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Covenant as it eſtabliſhes a Marriage Union, ſo it eſtabliſhes a Marriage Fellowſhip; the Fellowſhip and COmmunion grounded on this Union, makes it a Marriage Fellowſhip: Take a view of three or four things holden out in the Covenant, in reference to the Fellowſhip, and ye will find, as there is the neareſt Union, and the ſtrongeſt, and ſo a Marriage union, ſo there is a Marriage Fellowſhip. 1. Take a view of the Converſe that paſſes betwixt Chriſt and Bederers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Ye are the temple of the living God,</hi> as God hath ſaid, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in the, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me;</hi> Lay theſe expreſſions together, <hi>I will be their God, I will dwell in them, I will walk with them, and ſup with them;</hi> they look very like a Marriage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. 2. No only doeth that converſe prove this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Fellowſhip, but the Covenant holds out betwixt Chriſt and Believers a mutual Communication of Secrets; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will he <hi>walk in them, dwell in them, ſup with them,</hi> but he tells them all his Secrets, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervant, for the ſrevant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43047:29"/>hand, they put on him all their ſecrets, <hi>All my complaints is before him, and my groaning is not hid from him,</hi> ſaid <hi>David;</hi> It's remarkable, there are many things we grcan for, that we dare hardly tell any body what it is at the root of it; <hi>All my complaint is before thee.</hi> It wasa notable word <hi>Hannah</hi> had to <hi>Eli,</hi> when ſhe was mourning in the Temple, and he ſuppoſed her to be drunk, <hi>Put away from the thy wine,</hi> ſays he; <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>I am not drunk wiht wine, but am a woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit and I have poured out my complaint before the Lord.</hi> It's a Metaphor taken from a Bottle, that a man is pouring out, until it be all poured our from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and this is like a Marriage Fellowſhip indeed, He is their God, and they are his, he walks in them, and dwells in them, and ſups with them, and he tells them all that he has heard of his Father, and they pour out their complaint, and their very groaning is not hid from him.</p>
            <p>But 3. If ye take notice how the Covenant holds out, their ſtanding and falling together like married perſons, as the Woman marries the Man for good and ill, the alteration of the Huſbands lot, from being ſtrong to be ſickly, from being rich, to become poor, from being honourable, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſpiſed, it looſes not the Marriage Union, the Union is ſtill bound. The fellowſhip betwixt Chriſt and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is of this nature, it's like the Marriage of Married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that if ever they be tender, it's when they are Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then their affections boyls moſt; it's ſo with Chriſt, like a kindly Huſband, he is moſt tender of his married Wife: It's remarkable, when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, he looked up, and ſaw Jeſus ſtanding at the Fathers right hand, the Father ſaid to him, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thy footſtool.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>And when he brigeth in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, let all the angels worſhip him;</hi> but when any of them that he has Married is ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he lets them ſee Jeſus ſtanding at his right hand, and all the Angels of God ſtand and worſhip him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If ye take a view of the delight they have of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O the pleaſure he had of converſe with this peoply! <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Then I was by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight.</hi> On the other hand, what delight have they in him, when they ſit down under the ſhadow of the Apple-tree, and goes with him into the Garden, and into the Banoueting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43047:29"/>and finds his fruit ſweet to their taſte. So layall theſe together, and ye will ſee the Covenant, as it holds out a Trealy of Peace and War, as it opens a Traffique, as it's a Tranſaction betwixt Lord and Servant, ſo betwixt Floſband and Wife; ſo it's a Marriage Covenant, and it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes and Union and Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Before I leave this, there is one queſtion to be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, one may ask, How is it poſſible, that there ſhould be a Marriage Union betwixt Chriſt and his followers in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there may be a Treaty of Peance and War, there may be a Traffique betwixt Kings and Subjects, there may be a Covenant, as betwixt Lord and Maſter, but how can there be a Covenant, as betwixt Huſband and Wife The great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his difficulty is, the inequality betwixt the parties he is the Potter, and we are are the Clay, and the Potter to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Clay, there is not only a phyſical difference, but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, He is infinitly holy, and we are exceedingly ſinful, and how then can it be a Marriage Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For clearing of this, I deſire ye may take notice of three or four things; 1. Our blood is honoured and made noble, by the aſſumiing of our Nature into a Perſonal Union with the God-head, this has in effect preferred our Nature to the Nature of Angels, Man is now exalted above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they think it no diſgrace to them, they were our elder Brethren by Creation, and they were more noble Creatures, and we were made a little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but now they think it no diſgrace to worſhip One that is Man, and to follow Him where ever He goes: How low ſoever we be by Creation, yet our Blood is Nobilitat, in that it's unite to the Perſon of the God-head, in the Perſon of the Mediator. 2. Take notice of this, That Chriſt has a way of purifying theſe that He marries, the caſe is as it was with <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> and <hi>Eſther,</hi> ſhe is pitched on to marry <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,</hi> but there muſt be thirty days, wherein her Maids were to perfume her, before ſhe was married, this was Typical, and ſhews, that though there be an inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt parties, yet Chriſt has a way of purifying, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them that have an ill ſmell'd breath, to give a ſweet ſmell, He has perſumes that can make them ſweet and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerous. 3. Though there be a great inequality betwixt the parties, yet the Covenant may drive this Marriage, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43047:30"/>how low ſoever we be by Creation, we are the Father Gife in Election to the Son, the Father gave Believers to the Son in Election, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And that ye may be put to it, take up the Covenant as a Marriage Covenant; I will but give you theſe three Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are neceſſary in ones carrying a Marriage Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I exhort you to pearken to Chriſt's wooing motions, all the Sermons, and Scriptures that are the grounds of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they are indeed Chriſt's wooing motions, he would not only be at peace with them, and have a Traffique with them, but he would have a Marriage; It's true, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, ye may ſay, as <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid, ſhe was married to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſeet to take her to him to wife, I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to waſh the Feet of the ſervants of my Lord, yet ſhe aroſe and went to meer the Meſſengers to go with him; indeed we are not worthy to go to his Marriage-bed, and to be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with the priviledges of the Covenant, yet entertain his wooing motions.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:43047:30"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would deſire you to conſider, what the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch a Marriage is, O ſuch a joynture as he prepares, though he get no Tocher, as a wonderful joynture he gives; It's remarkable, <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had married <hi>Eſther,</hi> a poor maid, <hi>Mordeci</hi>'s Neice, yet he loves her, ſo that he ſays to her at the Feaſt of the Banquet of Wine, what is thy petition Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> and it ſhall be granted to thee, even to the half of my Kingdom: But theſe are not the Terms that he makes to his Bride: they are ſtrange offers in the Covenant, concerning my Sons and my Daughters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ye me; <hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my Name, he ſhall give it thee; Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee according to the deſire of thy ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ye may enter this Marriage Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Terms on which ye muſt enter, as a Woman in Marriage does when ſhe marries Huſband, ſhe marries him for good and ill, readily ye may ſee your Huſbands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts very low, but let not that diſſolve the Marriage; as guiltineſs will not diſſolve the Marriage on his part, ſo the Croſs attendig him ſhould not looſe it on our part. Now they that underſtand the Covenant rightly, and know what they are doing, when they are perſonally Covenanting with him, they do all the four, they accept of him as a Friend, to be at peace with him, and to have common Friends, and common Enemies; and they accept of a Covenant of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, that they will <hi>buy gold and fine linen;</hi> and they accept him as a Lord; but eſpecially they take him for a Huſband, the Covenant is a Marriage Covenant. Theſe four will ſum up the great Heads of the Covenant. But to go further.</p>
            <p>The third thing I would open is, how this Covenant is made up on all theſe four Heads; I will not here ſpeak of the Mediators part, I pitched on that elſe, and ſhewed you what the Mediator did, in reference to the Covenant. But for the making up of all theſe four ſorts of Covenant, there are two things neceſſary to make it up. 1. There muſt be conſent to all the Articles by both parties. And 2. There muſt be Obligations to ſecure the conſent for the future, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways variable Creatures like us, if there were not a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and a curſe put into the Covenant, what would our conſent ſignifie? Now both the two are neceſſar, in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43047:31"/>of all theſe four ſorts of Covenants, in all the Head and Articles of it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> There muſt be conſent of parties, to make up the Covenant. <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Obligation trom the hazard or curſe, in caſe that inſent be paſt from; and here I will ſpeak a little of the Conſent, that is neceſſary to make up this Covenant, I need not ſpeak of the Conſent on Gods part; I will evidence to you, the moſt hearty conſent that ever wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> given to a Contract on His part, by theſe three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He committed the drawing of the Govenant to the Mediator, It's true the Prophets were the Pen-men and Secretaries, but the Mediator was the Inſpirer of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, now it was an evidence of His hearty conſent, that He committed the drawing of the Covenant to the Mediator, and tis Glory is a thouſand times more advanced by the Covenant of Grace, than it was by the Covenant of Works all the payment He would have gotten from <hi>Adam,</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the payment he hath gotten from His Son; if all the Angels, if all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> had met together to do Him ſervice, they would not all make up ſuch a piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as he got from His Son, the Man that was His Fellow. 2. His conſenti's all along declared in the Scripture, why has He penned this Bible, and appointed his Miniſters to Preach and preſs it on people, if He were not ſerious in his deſigns? Why makes he ſuch proteſtations, <hi>As I live, I delight not in the death of ſinners.</hi> Why weeps he when his offers are refuſed, as he did over Jeruſalem, if he had not given his conſent in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? 3. The Mediator that drew the Covenant, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it by a Teſtament with His Blood; of all the perſons that ever were received into Glory, He received Him in the greateſt Triumph, when he welcomed His firſt-born Son to Glroy, He ſet Him down on His right hand, and bade <hi>all the angels worſhip him?</hi> If He had not done Him the greateſt Service, would He have uſed Him ſo? And would He had ſo great pleaſure to have them <hi>ſinging, Worthy, worthy is the Lamb;</hi> But all the matter in making up the Covenant, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Conſent to the Covenant; now a Chriſtian gives his conſent to the Covenant, and thereby in all the four Heads, makes it to be a ſure and faſt Bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We give our conſent to the Covenant in the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> as we gave an implicite conſent to the Covenant of Works in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo we gave a conſent to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43047:31"/>of Grace in the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> Here you would take notice that though the Covenant of Grace be made with all Believers, and every particular Believer may make uſe of it, as if it were only intended for him; yet the principal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Treating the Covenant are, the Father, and the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; the Covenant of Grace is eſpecially made with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; now when the Meſſiah giveth His conſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Covenant, as a Publick Perſon ſtanding in the room, and ſupplying the place of all the Elect, we gave our conſent in Him; and the truth is, there is never a Chriſtian that comes to be backward to imbrace the Covenant, or that after they had imbraced the Covenant, breaks it, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they ſay, that Chriſt conſented to more than they will ſtand to; for as the Father in Baptiſm binds the Son to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo the Mediator as a Publick Perſon, ſtanding in the room of all the Elect, the Father had given His conſent, and the Mediator had given His conſent to the Covenant in all our Names, and has engaged to get our conſent; as a Huſband may conſent for the Wife, or the Parent may conſent for the Child that is a Minor; ſo doeth Chriſt as a publick Perſon conſent in our Name, and who ever break the Covenant, they as it were, flee away from our conſent of the Covenant, Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted betwixt the Father and the Mediator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We give our conſent to all the Articles of the Covenant in our Baptiſm: A Chriſtian before he can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to other Lovers, the Lord keeps him as it were from the Womb, he will give him his Name, the Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; it's true the Parent binds for the Children, as men may make Bonds binding their Heirs, ſo they have a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to bind for their Children to God: There are two conſents we give, and both of them are implicite, our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents binds us to be Chriſt Friends in Baptiſm, to <hi>buy of him gold, fine linen,</hi> and to accept of him for our Lord, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, and to have neareſt Union with him, and the ſweeteſt Communion that may be enjoyed: But there is a two-fold explicite conſent, that we give to the Covenant; <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's an explicite conſent, when we accept of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Priviledges of the Church, the Word and Sacraments; when we accept of theſe and ſtate our ſelves Members of the Church, the very accepting of the Priviledges, is a conſent to all the Articles of the Covenant; a perſon that is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43047:32"/>not reſolved to be ſerious in taking the Covenant on all theſe four Heads, had done better not to have accepted the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church, the very accepting of the priviledge, to go to the Church, to get your Children Baptized, to come to the Table of the Lord, is as much as to ſay, I will ſtand to what the Mediator Treated, and what my Parents did engage to, when I was Baptized. 2. We give this explicite conſent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Sacrament of the Supper, or at any time that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian comes under a perſonal Vow, both of theſe are expreſs conſents, ſo that, though it may be, as ye will hear, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be not cordial; for there are many kinds of conſents to the Covenant; though I ſay the conſent be not cordial, yet it's enough to bring thee under the curſes of the Covenant; though it bring thee not under the bleſſings of the Covenant, thou has neither a Covenant of Friendſhip, nor a Covenant of Traffique; the Mediator gave his conſent, and thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents gave their conſent, and in they accepting of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, and the Sacrament of the Supper, thou gave thine; and though they bring thee not to to be married to the Mediator, yet they may bring thee under the Curſe of the Covenant; for when it may be thou replyes, thou did not give thy conſent to the Covenant, but thy conſent was given, in thy accepting of the priviledges of the Church; or when thou came to the Sacrament of the Supper, or came under a perſonal Vow, and in this conſent, either we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and cordially imbrace the Covenant, or by our conſent we expoſe our ſelves to all the curſes of it; the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent engages us to all the curſes of it, therefore will he ſay unto thee, <hi>Out of thy mouth I condemn thee;</hi> So the Father is cordial in in his conſent, and the Mediator can bear him witneſs of it; and all in the viſible Church, they viſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they ſtand to the Covenant, at he drew it, they approve of the conſent he gave, and that their Parents gave in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and by their accepting of the outward priviledges of the Church, and when they take the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they give their own conſent, and when they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own conſent, they are either under all the curſes of the Covenant, or all the bleſſings of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> I will only clear one caſe of Conſcience, that may be very obvious againſt this Doctrine, and ſo ſhall cloſe this Sermon; ſome may ſay, I am afraid to give an expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43047:32"/>or elſe I would go home from this Sermon, and go to a corner and tell him, I owne what the Mediator did, when he conſented to the Covenant in my Name; I owne what my Parents did in Baptiſm, and I give my own conſent, and gives my hand, and as it were ſtrikes hand with the Father; I will go and do all theſe things, but I am afraid to give my conſent, on a two-fold account. 1. I am afraid that my conſent be not ſincere. And 2. I am afraid that it be not abiding. I confeſs this is a great Objection, for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant cannot be really Treated, but by Confenters who are upright, and who will perſevere.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to the Queſtion, I will offer you two or three things. 1. I would have you notice, that ſeveral times, the firſt motive of the Souls conſenting to Covenant with God, it's often fear, I confeſs indeed, fear is a changeable thing, and we may do with our fears, asthe fame goes of the man, that when he was upon Sea, he Vowed to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that if he came ſafely to Land, he would offer her a pound of Candle, but when he came to Shore, he ſaid a plack candle might ſerve her; our reſolution alters with our Fears, yet many times fear of Hell, and deſire of Heaven, drives on the beginning. Ye muſt not think the work will not be ſincere, becauſe the fear of Hell may be at the bottom of thy conſenting to the Covenant, no, like a Woman that is marrying a Man, the firſt motive of the Marriage is, he is a great man, and has a great Eſtate, and I will have an eaſie life with him, but yet afterward ſhe comes to love him for himſelf; the beginning of the work, and thy giving thy hearts conſent to owne the Mediator, in what he did, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be fear of Hell, and love of Heaven, and thou may love the man that is offered to be thy Huſband, becauſe thou wilt get great things with him, yet afterward thou will love him for himſelf, therefore ſtand not at it on this account, but come forward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take notice, that ſometimes there may be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearty conſent, when yet's it but ill expreſt, there may be much in the heart, and little in the expreſſion; the truth is, the caſe is in our conſenting to the Covenant, as with two men, the one is an honeſt man, and down not endure cheating, but for his hand-writ, he can draw no hing but his mark; the other man is a Clerk, and can draw excellent Letters, and Gild them all with Gold, but he has a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43047:33"/>hand, and a falſe heart: In thy conſent to the Covenant though thou can but take up more of thy ill, and knows not what thy comfort is, yet there may be much love, thou art like the man that is writing only his mark, and the fear of Hell and love of Heaven: makes thee given thy conſent and where thou haſt given thy conſent, thou cannot write thy own name but thy mark, yet come forward write thy mark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I exhort thee that makes this doubt, to conſider that the ſtrength to perſevere in the Covenant, when thou haſt conſented, it muſt come from the Covenant; the caſt is with us, as with ſome poor men that comes to a Writer and bids him write the Bond of ſuch a Sum, and after it is writter, he bids him pay for the writing of it, and he ſaith, I have nothing to pay for it, until the Bond be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me; in the point of perſeverance it's ſo with us, we are not to go and torment our ſelves with, I will fall away I will not perſevere, we are not bound to pay for the Bond until that the Bond be payed to us; therefore it is the ground leſeſt thing in the world to ſtand at, I will not give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Covenant, for I will not be ſincere, I will not get bidden at it, but I will give my conſent, when the Bond is payed to me, and then I will pay for the writing of it, and I will get ſtrength to perform, and to perſevere; thou has no furniture, neither for being cordial, nor for perſeverance, until conce the Bond be begun to be payed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Chriſtian know, thou that ſtands at conſention on theſe Grounds, know this for certainty, that there has a great many entred in Covenant with Chriſt, and conſented to it, they have gone and made a perſonal Covenant, and holden up their hand, and Vowed it in a Covenant with God, that were as weak at the beginning as thou, and by their hanging on the Promiſes of the Covenant, have been keeped conſtant; if in thy conſent to the Covenant, and endeavouring to keep it, if thou honeſtly endeavour to keep it, every breach of it will not make him caſt thee out of it. I confeſs ſome Covenants men will make, they have this clauſe in it, if the one fail, the other is looſe, the Maſter and Servant are free at the Term; it's not ſo in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, the Covenant of Grace binds God to his own Faithfulneſs, and his Son, <hi>if we believe not, he abides faithful, he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> the ſcope of this is, to put
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43047:33"/>you, to owne your Mediators conſent, and your Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and go home and ſtrike hands with Him, and accept of the Covenant of Peace, and a Covenant of Traffique, that ye will be more in going to the Mercat, where <hi>gold, eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve, fine-linen,</hi> are to be ſold, <hi>without money, and without price,</hi> and that ye will accept him for a Lord; and readily when the Bond is beginning to be payed, ye will find enough for ſtedfaſtneſs and ſincerity. There is Gods part, and our part in the Covenant, and we will never do any thing at our part, until He begin to do at His part, all the furniture on our part muſt come from Him; therefore we can never be the firſt pay-maſter, and can never be the Party in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that will begin firſt to pay the Articles of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; no, in the day we Covenant with Him, we make this an expreſs Article in the Covenant, Lord, till thou fulfil thy part, I can never fulfil my part.</p>

            <p>I Divided this Verſe in five Branches, the firſt Branch was the Nature of the Security, that <hi>David</hi> had from God for his encouragement, he calls it <hi>a Covenant;</hi> I have dwelt on this at length, though Divines that write of the Covenant, inſiſt on ſeveral things that I have not mentioned, yet I need dwell no longer in opening the nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant than I have done; there is no man, nor ſociety of man can looſe the Obligation of a Covenant; it always binds, either to the Duties, or to the Curſe and Penalty of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and if we caſt off the Obligation to the Duty, wely under the Obligation to the Penalty.</p>
            <p>But before I yet leave this Branch, there is one thing I propoſed in the Point when I named it, that I will dwell on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43047:34"/>in the Work of this day, which is, to evidence and prove, that this Covenant is a Covenant of Grace for ſo I told you in the propoſing of the Point, that the great ground of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement at death is, <hi>the Covenant of Grace:</hi> I confeſs, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not where in all the Scripture it's expreſly called by this Name; It's called <hi>a Covenant of Peace,</hi> and <hi>a Covenant of Promifes,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. And it's called <hi>a Covenant conſiſting of mercies,</hi> Iſa. 55. <hi>I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, even the ſure mercies of David:</hi> the root and end of it is ſaid to be Grace, <hi>to the praiſe and glory of his grace,</hi> and to the <hi>exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his grace:</hi> There are multitudes of Names given it in the Bible, equivalent to this Name <hi>a Covenant of Grace;</hi> Therefore it may very rationally have this Name <hi>a Covenant of Grace.</hi> But the thing I intend to follow in the work of the day is, to do theſe four things, and if the Lord be with us, and bleſs us, they may be for our edification and advantage. 1. I will prove and make appear to you, that this everlaſting Covenant, this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ſure Covenant, is a Covenant abſolutely of Grace. 2. I will ſhew you ſome reaſons, why God in Tranſacting this Covenant, would have it to be entirely a Covenant of Grace. 3. I ſhall clear an Objection or two. And laſtly ſhall help you to improve it, in reference to ſome particular caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For proving that it's a Covenant abſolutely of Grace, I muſt firſt clear what is meaned by the word <hi>Grace.</hi> It's true, ſometimes it's put for inherent Grace, which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts call <hi>Gratia gratum faciens.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jeſus Christ:</hi> moſt ordinarly it's put for Gods <hi>free favour and good will,</hi> ſo we find Rom. 11. <hi>If it be of grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace would not he grace.</hi> And when we call it a Covenant of Grace, the meaning is, it's a Covenant conſiſting of meer Favour and Good-will; and this is the thing I am to make out this day, that this Covenant is abſolutely and entirely a covenant of Grace: I confeſs this is a generally ſuppoſed Principle among Chriſtians, yet it's not well underſtood. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That covenant which is founded neither in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Creature, nor in any alluring motive from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt be a covenant of Grace with the Creature; there are muſt be a covenant of Grace with the Creature; there are ordinarly two things that influence Tranſactions and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, the merit of the Creature, or if there be no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſome alluring motive; <hi>Abimelech</hi> entered in a Covenant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43047:34"/>with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe he ſaw God was with him, <hi>Shechem</hi> is content to enter in a Covenant with <hi>Jacob's</hi> Children, for <hi>all their cattel</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will be ours:</hi> Many will enter in Covenants with others, either on the account of merit, a Maſter will covenant with his Servant to pay him his Fee, and that becauſe he hath wrought well; or if there be no merit, they go on ſome alluring motive: a man will enter in a Marriage covenant, ſometimes on the account of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſometimes on the account of riches; but God is entering in a Covenant with us, ſaw neither merit, nor any alluring motive: as for our beauty, Ezekiel 16.6. <hi>When I paſt by thee, thou waſt caſt out in the high-way, lying in thy blood, to the ſhame of thy nakedneſs, and no eye pitied thee, I paſsed by thee, and caſt my skirt over thee, and the time was a time of love:</hi> And for our goodneſs and riches, Pſal 50.12. <hi>If he were hungry he needed not tell us, for the cattel upon a thouſand hills belong to him;</hi> and Pſal. 16.2. <hi>Our goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not the thee:</hi> He had been no leſs glorious nor happy, if He had never created Man, it had diminiſhed nothing from His infinite perfection. Now a Covenant founded and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted betwixt Him and us, where there is neither merit, nor any alluring motive, muſt abſolutely be a Covenant of free will and entire Grace.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> the evince this yet further, that it is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant abſolutely of Grace, compare it with the Covenant of Works, the Covenant made with <hi>Adam;</hi> for in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> there was indeed Grace in it, yet not ſo much Grace as appeared in this Covenant; the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venat made with <hi>Adam,</hi> was made with a perſon that did not merit a Covenant, yet it was made with an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man; however he had not provoked God, yet he did not merit that God ſhould Covenant with him; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> was made with an undeſerving man indeed: but He makes the Covenant of Grace with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>For when we were yet enemies, Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. And he gave Himſelf for the ungodly, and not for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; any of us may know by our own temper, if we ſhall make that the meaſure, whereby to conſider Acts of Grace, if a man had never wronged us, nor injured us, in word or in deed, how ready are we to make peace with Him; but if he had done his outmoſt out of malice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43047:35"/>of heart, it's not eaſie to fall under a Covenant with him; The Covenant made with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> was made with an innocent man, that had done nothing to diſoblige Him; but when He made the Covenant of Grace, He made it with fallen man, the ungodly man that was his enemy; now what a great deal of Grace was there in this, if we had bound up Covenants of friendſhip and fellowſhip with a man, and if he had betrayed and gone contrare to his engagements, and turned implacable and vindictive, would we bind up a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with that man again? And the caſe was ſo, when He treated a Covenant of Grace, He not only ſaw no merit, nor alluring motive, but he ſaw us in a ſtate of enmity, yet that hindered him not to make a Covenant with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſhew the Grace of this Covenant, conſider the great Bleſſings that he is content to promiſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for in the Covenant, far greater Bleſſings than in the Covenant of Works; nothing contributes more to evidence it to be a Covenant of Grace, than the conſideration of the Bleſſings promiſed in the Covenant. I ſuppoſe a man ſhould take a Beggar, or a Prince ſhould take a Rebel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him his Life, and make him his Kitchin-Boy, and give him liberty of ſcour the Veſſel, and to turn the Roſt, it were much; but if he Indenture with him, that he ſhall feed him with Wine, and Milk, and Honey, and Spices, and give him Gold in his Purſe, and Eve-ſalve, nay more, if he Indenture with him to give him his Son in marriage, nay, to give him himſelf, conſidering there is neither merit, nor alluring motive for this, the perſon is a Rebel, a baſe and unworthy man: in the Covenant of Grace, the Lord hath taken this way to evidence the Grace of it, to ſpeak with reverence, it's impoſſible for him to promiſe greater things, He is at the outmoſt of what he can do, and Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels admire of what He can do; however He be infinite in Power, yet it's impoſſible, to ſpeak with reverence, for the eternal God, to promiſe greater things than Himſelf, and his Son, for all Eternity, and that in ſuch a way, as the creature can be capable to enjoy; ſo that conſidering the great Bleſſings of the Covenant, not to ſpeak of Pardon, Peace and Communion, and Joy, but to promiſe Himſelf and his Son: In the Covenant He promiſes to give His Son to ſuffer, to be a curſe, and ſubject him to the loweſt things,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43047:35"/>except Sin, that He could be capable of. It is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt us and Papiſts, if He deſcended locally into Hell, we deny it; but we maintain that He had the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent of the Pains of Hell on his Spirit; and that Article of our Bellef, is to be underſtood of horrour of Spirit; now to advance us to the greateſt priviledges we can be capable of, which are the enjoyment of Himſelf and his Son for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the perfecteſt meaſure we can be capable of, what a deal of Grace is in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To evidence that it's thus a Covenant of Grace, conſider on what Terms in the Covenant theſe great things are; and indeed here eſpecially lies the Grace of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, any would think the Terms behoved to be very high, conſidering the Glory of the Merchant, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Marriage; here is the matchleſs Grace of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Terms on which all theſe are offered, makes it indeed of Grace; and in reference to the Terms, I will offer theſe five remarkable Conſiderations, that evidence it a Covenant of Grace. 1. He that offers theſe Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, offers them with a free Diſcharge of all bygone Debt. If for the future the Covenant will be embraced, this is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Article, to evidence the freedom of the Terms; there is no blaſphemous perſon like <hi>Paul,</hi> none that hath had ſeven Devils like <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> there is no perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor like <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> it's ſuppoſed he was one of the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible perſecutors, of whom the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſpeaks <hi>of ſawing aſunder,</hi> he ſawed <hi>Iſaiah</hi> aſunder with a Saw; no Publican like <hi>Matthew,</hi> no denyer of Chriſt like <hi>Peter,</hi> no murderer and adulterer like <hi>David;</hi> no perſon of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever guilt, except one Sin, He hath excepted the Sin againſt His Spirit, but he is content in the Covenant, if any embrace and take hold of the offers, He will paſs all by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones, if there be accurat walking for the time to come. <hi>2dly.</hi> It's remarkable in the Terms, that He requires no other condition, but allanerly Faith and its Concomitants; this is in effect as much as a free Diſcharge, and ye ſhall not pay for it, only humbly and thankfully accept of it; Faith is altogether conſiſtent with Grace: ſuppoſe there were a great man would offer a Begger a Talent, is it not an Alms, and an Act of Grace, if there be no more required of the Beggar, but to take the Alms? The Covenant of Grace runs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43047:36"/>in this Channel, only believe, accept of the Offer of my ſelf, and of my Son, for all eternity, and this is all that is required. <hi>3dly.</hi> The leaſt degree of this acceptance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it be ſincere and not counterfit, the Covenant accepts of it; if your Faith be as the Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be never ſo ſmall, if it be not counterfit, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant accepts of it. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> the Covenant accepts of it, though it be mixed with much Corruption; that poor man in the Goſpel that came crying to Chriſt, hath a kindly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Help me, Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.</hi> Mark 9.23. My Faith hath a great deal of droſs among it, it is as large unbelief, as Faith, <hi>but, Lord, help my unbelief.</hi> Now the Covenant that runs on theſe Terms, is not this a Covenant abſolutely of Grace?</p>
            <p>But <hi>laſtly,</hi> to add no more, it's evident to be a Covenant of Grace, if ye conſider the way how this Covenant is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; it's not only without merit, and alluring motives it's not only made with fallen Man, and not only with at innocent Man, not only holds it out the greateſt things God can give, and on the freeſt Terms: But laſtly, it's evident to be a Covenant of Grace, if we conſider how He follows it. I will name but three or four things how He follows it, and they will evidence it yet further to be a Covenant of Grace 1. He is the firſt ſeeker and offerer of a Covenant; any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would think that we ſhould begin the motion, for we were the men that had the toom hand, and He had the full; but yet He is the beginner, and He may ſay of any when they are effectually called, and brought under the Bond of the Covenant, <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not, and ſought them that asked not for me. 2dly,</hi> It's remarkable in the way of following it, that the perſons whom He follows, they are not only in all things equal with others, but ſeveral times they are worſe than others, if ye take a view of them in their natural priviledges: was not <hi>Eſau Jacobs</hi> brother, and the elder brother, and had the Birth-right, <hi>Yet Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated:</hi> Ordinarily theſe that he follows to bring under the Covenant, are alike in all things, two lying in one Womb, two grinding at the Miln, two on the houſe top; yet He makes a Covenant with the one, and paſſes by the other: but often they are worſe than others, often-times ye will find them ſimpler than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43047:36"/>they are the fooliſheſt things, <hi>things that are not;</hi> yea ſometimes they are very ignorant, and that in the great things of the Goſpel, the ſubtilties of Philoſophy are almoſt ridiculous to them; yea, many times they are the worſt and greateſt of ſinners that He brings under the bond of the Covenant, the like of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Manaſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h:</hi> Now that He ſhould follow the Covenant thus, that He ſhould follow them that have the ſame things naturally, they are pieces of Clay out of the ſame Pit, they are Stones out of the ſame Quarree, and that He ſhould make choiſe of one like a ſhrub, and the things He leaves like tall Cedars. What a deal of Grace is there in it, that He ſhould take the ſhrub, and pitch upon it, bring it under the Covenant, and leave them that are wiſe for Wit and Learning. <hi>3dly.</hi> If ye take a view of this, the Grace of the Covenant will appear, that after He hath ſought them, and found them, and feltered them, and bound them with the Cords of the Covenant: the Grace of it appears in this, that once bound, and ay bound: it's everlaſting, there is no getting out under it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: it contributes to evidence the Grace of the Covenant, that He will bide ſo many refuſals, that He will <hi>ſtand, and knock at the door, until his head be wet with the dew, and his locks with the drops of the night,</hi> and then put His hand at the hole of the lock, if he can get but an hole in the door, though He cannot get an open door, He will put in His Finger at the hole of the door, and drop in Mirrhe upon the handles of the lock: may not all theſe things evidence the Grace of the Covenant; but nothing evidences it more than this, that no unbelief, no guiltineſs will caſt without the Covenant again; if once in Covenant with Him, once in, and ay in it: Thus He covenanted with <hi>David,</hi> if his children offend, He will correct them with the rods of men, <hi>He will viſit their iniquity with rods, and their tranſgreſſions with stripes;</hi> He will ſend them to priſons, and to ſcaffolds, <hi>but his preſence nor his loving kindneſs will he not take from them.</hi> Now lay all theſe together, and I hope I have evinced to you, that this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is abſolutely and entirely a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> I would clear one Objection before I give you the Reaſons of it: May not ſome ſay, are there not conditions in the Covenant, and are they not difficult, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be performed? Can that be a Covenant of Grace, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43047:37"/>calls for ſelf-denyal, for taking up of the croſs, for repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for faith, for being holy as God is holy? Nay more, it calls for all the duties of the Covenant of Works, and more; for the Covenant of Works bound <hi>Adam</hi> neither to repentance, nor faith; but this Covenant binds to obedience to the whole Law, and to repentance, and believing, which the Covenant of Works did not; and can this be a Covenant of Grace that runs in this channel?</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Antinomians</hi> indeed ſay, there are no conditions, and therefore they deny it to be a proper Covenant; they ſay, it's rather a Promiſe than a Covenant; we maintain there are Conditions in it, and all theſe things are true, it binds to obedience to the whole Law; but there are three things in the conditions, that in effect make them nothing contrare to this, that it's a Covenant of Grace. 1. There is no condition in it to be performed in our own ſtrength: a man goes quite from the Covenant of Grace, that would wring repentance out of his own heart, or that would pray, or preach, or hear, in his own ſtrength; indeed this ſuited well with the Covenant of Works; and when we go like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> in our own ſtrength, we go directly from the Covenant of Grace; the Father in the Covenant, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Nurſe to bear us up, He hath appointed a Tutor to govern and guide us, a Purſe-maſter to bear our ſtock, <hi>ſo that of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, we can do nothing;</hi> according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, we are to do nothing; whether to ſuffer, to pray, to preach, to hear, the Covenant is ſo contrived, that all theſe things called for, are not called for in our own ſtrength; we break the Covenant, if we wring them out in our own ſtrength; the main thing is to lay our ſtock in Chriſts hand, whether to do, or to ſuffer, it's according to the Tenor of the Covenant, that we ſhould be ſupplied by his Grace, that we ſhould have wiſdom, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and all from Him, which is a neceſſary thing for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to obſerve, that take them to the Covenant of Grace; they are ſometimes exceedingly prejudged by not eyeing this Covenant, when they pray, or go to hear, they think the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture they have from Grace, or the habitual Grace they have, will carry them through the duty; no, ye break the Covenant, if ye eye not Him in all things the Covenant calls for. <hi>2ly.</hi> Although there be many conditions in the Covenant, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43047:37"/>is a condition on our part, but it's a promiſe on Gods part; there cannot be that Duty inſtanced in all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for which there is not a Promiſe; ſo is the buſineſs contrived, as if he ſaw a Merchant that lays out a piece of cloth to a man to buy, and the man hath no money to buy it with, but he engageth to give him money; but before he buy it, the Merchant promiſeth to give him Money to buy it with: ſo there is no Duty, let it be named Mortification, or Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, there is no Grace required, or Duty to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but there is a Promiſe in reference to that Grace, and that Duty. Now ſince there is no condition on our part, but there is a Promiſe on Gods part; the condition makes nothing againſt the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> There is no condition in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the want whereof will caſt us out of the Covenant; it's remarkable, the Covenant betwixt God and us, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, is not made as a bargain betwixt two men, wherein they engage, I vow and promiſe to do this to you, providing ye do this to me, I will give you ſuch a Sum of money, if ye give me againſt ſuch a day ſuch a piece of cloth, and if he bring it not againſt ſuch a day, the other is looſed from the condition of the money: where there is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bargain, he that falls on the one part of the condition, he loſes the other, it's not a binding obligation: It's not ſo in this Covenant, though there be conditions in the Covenant, our not fulfilling of the condition, looſes not God from His part of it; if there were any thing that would looſe Him, Faith being the great condition of the Covenant, it would be the want of Faith; if we believe not, <hi>yet he abides faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> There are conditions in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but there is no condition required ſo, that if once we be in the Covenant, will looſe God from the condition on His part of it: the reaſon of it is, the Cautioner in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, becomes bound for our failing in the Covenant, and what is wanting in our Sanctification and Obedience, the Lord gets ſatisfaction for it in Chriſts Righteouſneſs: So there are conditions and great things required; yet they make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt it's being a Covenant of Grace. I hope from all this, I have in this Sermon abundantly evinced, that this everlaſting Covenant, is properly a Covenant of Grace, though it hath conditions in it.</p>

            <p>IT's an Act of Grace that God did ever condeſcend to any kind of Covenant with man, ſo great a God, but to make ſuch a Covenant, a Covenant of Promiſes, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> great and precious Promiſes, we may indeed do as the builders that builded the ſecond Temple, cry, Grace, grace unto him. I was proving in the forenoon, that this Covenant was a Covenant of Grace, notwithſtanding o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all the conditions in it: Before I proceed in the following of it, I would have you notice, that when the Covenant is called a Covenant of Grace, ye are to ſuppoſe, that the Grace of the Covenant hath theſe three properties. 1. It's a Covenant of pure and unmixed Grace, there is nothing but Grace in it, there is neither merit, nor motive, and therefore the whole contrivement of it is Grace and only Grace. <hi>2ly.</hi> While we call it a Covenant of Grace, it is not only to be underſtood of pure and unmixed Grace, but of perfect Grace; the Grace in the Covenant is advanced to ſo great a hight, as the definition of perfection agrees to it. Moraliſts ſay, that that is perfect in which nothing is wanting, and to which nothing can be added; now the Grace of the Covenant is of this nature. <hi>3ly.</hi> When we call it a Covenant of Grace, it's to be underſtood of perſevering Grace, Grace which cannot be changed: Some things may be pure and perfect, but they are variable: the moſt part of the kindneſſes of Cretures are of this nature; let them run like a burn in a ſpait, yet a Summer comes, and they dry, it's not ſo with the Fountain: They ſay, the original of all Springs is the Ocean, and that the Waters grows freſh running through the bowels of the Earth, and they muſt drain the Ocean, ere they drain the Spring; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43047:38"/>then it be perſevering Grace; ſo that when we call it a Covenant of Grace, the meaning is, it's a Covenant of pure unmixed Grace, perfect and full Grace, and of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and continuing Grace. But before I improve this, the calling it a Covenant of Grace, becauſe it will have a great influence on all the Sermons following, I would clear two or three queſtions that may come in, as Objections againſt the Covenant being a Covenant of Grace,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. <hi>It</hi> may be objected, what reaſons or motives, ſince there was neither meriting, nor moving conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what riſe could this Covenant have, to be a Covenant of pure, perfect, and preſerving Grace? Theſe that write of this Head, bring a number of reaſons, they ſay, that God intended to humble man, and to make him inexcuſable, for when He ſhall judge him at the great day, he will have no thing that will be a clock of excuſe, according to that word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22 <hi>If I had not come unto them, and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin; but now they have no clock for their ſin.</hi> To refuſe a Covenant of Grace, takes off all clock of excuſe; I deny not, but there may be many reaſons why He made it a Covenant of ſo pure, perfect, and perſevering Grace: but I conceive, the ſpecial reaſons why it's ſo made, may be reduced to theſe two. 1. He made it thus of Grace, that it might be ſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith and by grace, that the promiſe might be ſure to the ſeed:</hi> Mark, there it's by Grace, that the Promiſe might be ſure; had God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with us in a Covenant on any terms in the world, but Grace, it would never have been ſure, ſuppoſe we had been as perfect as <hi>Adam;</hi> and had had as great a ſtock of grace within us, yet He would never make a bargain with the like of us, who were ſo changeable things, if the bottom of the bargain had not been Grace; therefore it's through Faith, and by Grace, that the Promiſe might be ſure to the ſeed; He knew what we were, when we were at our beſt, when we were new come off the ſtocks, and were new come from His Hands by Creation; probably <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood not above five hours, and what would a Covenant with the like of us ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, if it ſtood not on Grace? <hi>2ly.</hi> He made it thus of Grace, that He might exalt Chriſt: the ſecuring of us, and the exalting of His Son, both contribute exceedingly to His own Glory; afterward I will make it out to you, if the Lord
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43047:39"/>will, that the Father is infinitly more Glorified in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Covenant of Grace, than if the covenant of Works ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtood: but the great deſign He had in making a covenant of Grace, was to ſecure us, and exalt His Son; the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant runs in theſe Terms, that in all Daties, in all our ſufferings we muſt ay go to Chriſt for ſtrength. But if any would ask our right to the Crown, what ground we have to think, that He will not caſt us in Hell? how we will pray, how we will ſuffer, and believe, and how we think to be freed from Hell? The Anſwer of all theſe Queſtions is in one word, in Chriſt; the covenant is ſo contrived, as when we have to do for Wiſdom, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Righteouſneſs, Redemption, the truth is, in the covenant, Chriſt is made all things. <hi>He is the way, the truth, and the life, the door, the bread, the drink, and the apparel;</hi> the Apoſtle ſums them up in one word, <hi>He is all in all</hi> Now the exalting of His Son, never was there ſo ſubmſſive a Son to the Father, He was his Equal, and was content to be trampled on, and in a manner bruiſed, therefore the exalting of His Son, is the great contrivement of the covenant; ſo that in effect, it is of Grace, both that the Promiſe might be ſure to the ſeed, and that Chriſt might be exalted; in both which, the Glory of the Father is more advanced, than in all the Works of Creation and Providence; and that clears the firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, why God reſolved to make it a covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. The ſecond difficulty againſt this, that it's thus a covenant of pure, perfect, and perſevering Grace, How can this ſtand with the Juſtice of God, and with His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? God is naturally juſt, and infinitly juſt, and He as neceſſarly puniſhes ſin, as the fire burns, or as a weighty things moves downward? It's remarkable, the Scripture tells, He <hi>cannot behold iniquity, nor ſuffer it to go unpuniſhed;</hi> now to make with Rebels, and ſwear a covenant, to accept of men perfect holineſs, to accept of the Will for the Deed, to <hi>pardon iniquity,</hi> to <hi>caſt their ſins in the bottom of the ſea;</hi> to tell them in the covenant, <hi>the iniquity of Jacob ſhall be ſought for, and not be found;</hi> How ſtands this with Juſtice? Doth not Grace prevail over Juſtice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw,</hi> For Anſwer to this, know, that this covenant of Grace, is made on all theſe Terms that I ſpoke of it the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, without the leaſt violation of Juſtice, and two things
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43047:39"/>will evedience the truth of this. 1. Chriſt the Mediator of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he covenant, before He could accompliſh and order a covenant of Grace, He treated a covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I think indeed, that is a proper covenant, though generally forraign and domeſtick Divines have not adverted to it, yet many of late, have ſeen all the eſſentials of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in it; in the Son (before the covenant of Grace was, in all the particulars of it Tranſacted) He Tranſacted a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption with the Father, wherein He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to ſatisfie Juſtice, and the Covenant of Grace runs in ſo free a current and channel, on the account of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's indenturing the Covenant of Redemption. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's no wrong to Juſtice, to accept of a Cautioner, there was Mercy in the midſt of it; there was Grace in the Fathers accepting a ſatisfaction from the Son: The School-men ſpeak of the Fathers uniting the God-head with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſo glorifying the humane Nature, and the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Satisfaction from the Humane Nature, was an Act of Grace, yet ſuch an Act of Grace as Juſtice was ſatisfied fully by a perſon that had not committed thee deed: <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. The third queſtion I will move againſt this Truth, that it's a Covenant of Grace; ſome may ſay, there might have been more Grace in it than there is, there might have been Promiſes of perfect holineſs; now in all the Bible we have no Promiſe of perfect Sanctification: and which makes this the more difficult, we are commanded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour perfection, and yet we have no promiſe of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all the Scripture; we cannot go to God in Faith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43047:40"/>and pray, to make us perfect in this life, for we can Pray for nothing in Faith, whereof we want a Promiſe; ſo that it would ſeem, it's not of ſuch perfect Grace, as I have been ſaying, for there is not in all the Bible a promiſe of perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> For the clearing of this, I will offer you theſe three things. 1. It's the nature of ſincerity to aim at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it ſtands as it were on its Tip-toes, and ſtretches its arms to it; its true they are but childrens arms, and are but weak and cannot reach far off, yet there is never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity but there is an aim at perfection, therefore ye ſhall find the true godly, the moſt part of their exerciſes run not on the want of Grace, but on the weakneſs, inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and the Imperfection of Grace; The great reaſon is, ſincerity will be conſtantly complaining, untill it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, until it reach <hi>the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> therefore there comes in the heart that is upright ay ſome complaints, alas I cannot get grief proportioned to ſin, I cannot get love to God, alas, I cannot grieve enough for ſin; it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perfection in Scripture, becauſe it aims as perfection, and will ay be complaining until it be perfect. <hi>2ly.</hi> Know this, that though in all the Covenant there is not a promiſe of perfection, nor perfect Sanctification. no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we come to Glory, and untill the <hi>woman clothed with the Sun, have the Moon under his feet,</hi> there the Crown will be ſet on, and love and delight will be perfected; the great reaſon is, becauſe perfection here would neither ſuit our duty, nor our caſe, no, were there perfection of holineſs here, it would overturn the whole frame of the Covenant, which is, that we ſhall go to Chriſt for pardon, for healing for making up of wants: Perfection would be inconſiſtent with all theſe, beſide to be perfect here, would neither ſuit with time nor place; take the fineſt Gold, or the beſt Jewels, and lay them in a reikie houſe, readily they would get the ſmel of the reik: It's remarkable, ever <hi>Paul</hi> was it danger to be puffed up with abundance of Revelations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's no wonder, for as great as the Promiſes are that perfection be not promiſed, for the Jewel would be in a reikie houſe, and we would be puffed up with abundance of Revelations; ſo it's no way inconſiſtent with the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant its being a covenant of Grace, that the roving Patient hath not from the Phyſician, all that he crys for, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43047:40"/>gives what is ſuitable and agreeable to the nature of his caſe, ſo the covenant is of perfect Grace, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains promiſes of perfection, and ſo much Grace as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar for our caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. The fourth Difficulty I would move againſt this, the covenant its being a covenant of Grace, Doth it not contain the Croſs, and are there not a multitude of clauſes in it, bearing afflictions and croſſes? And indeed, ſome have obſerved, the threatning part of Afflictions in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, it often holds as true as the promiſing part of Peace; and pardon, which may be a very great ſcruple ſometimes in one, that has taken them to the covenant, and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to follow the guiſe of the world, they will credit the Promiſes, and take them to the covenant, and in the mean time, the only part of the covenant that is moſt veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is, that part which contains the Croſs; the Promiſes of <hi>ſupping with him, and bringing them into the banqueting houſe,</hi> they know little of that: But as for that part of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they know He hath been a <hi>true and faithful witneſs,</hi> and true to His word; now the queſtion is, looks this like the covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For anſwer to this, I deſire ye may take notice of three things, firſt, Take notice what the covenant removes, in reference to the Croſs, and we may go to God and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorly preſs Him, for removing theſe, nay readily He is faithful and true in removing of them. 1. Several times He will remove the curſe and ſting of the Croſs, all the Elect meet with that; The covenant has promiſed, and rather threatens the Croſs, but withal it's added, it ſhall come like a Bee, it may come bumming and making a noiſe, but it wants the ſting, and one needs not be afraid of a Bee that wants a ſting; the covenant has promiſed, that in reference to the Croſs, the curſe and ſting are both removed. <hi>2ly.</hi> The covenant has promiſed, the proportioning of the Croſs to our ſhoulders, it's indeed a ſpecial promiſe to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>He will not ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able to bear;</hi> He knows that which would be balaſt to one Veſſel, would drown another; therefore He calls a Chriſtian to ſuffer according as they have gotten Grace, every one is not for the ſervice that others are for, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if He give Effectual Calling, Pardon, Communion with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43047:41"/>Himſelf, and Peace,, one to ten thouſand, if that perſon go to the grave without ſome ſignal Croſs; ſo the Covenant ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures theſe two, it ſecures againſt the Curſe and Sting of the Croſs, and againſt a diſproportioned Croſs to our ſtrength. <hi>3ly.</hi> The Covenant ſecures of help under the Croſs, it bears them up, it's a wonder to ſee how that part of the Covenant has been accompliſhed, when I come to the ordering of the Covenant, I will have occaſion to ſpeak of it; theſe that have ſometime in their life been ſinking under fears, ſo that the leaſt noiſe of leafes on the Tree in the night time, and even their own ſhadow on the wall, would have feared them, in the time of Perſecution, have chearfully ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>caſt to the lions, and in the fire;</hi> The great reaſon is, the Covenant engaged for ſtrength under the Croſs; and the Lord has promiſed, if he call <hi>David</hi> to go againſt a <hi>Goliah,</hi> He ſhall deal with him as <hi>Saul</hi> did with <hi>David,</hi> he ſhall get on the King's Armour to fight with. <hi>4ly.</hi> He has ſecured this by the Covenant, that the Croſs ſhall be the way to the Crown; I deny not but there may be ſome in Glory, but certainly they will be rare, who have not come through Afflictions and Tribulations: and if they be in Glory, they ſhall be among the leaſt of the Kingdom of God; the Captain came through Afflictions, and why not the Soldiers; The Scripture ſpeaks generally, <hi>Theſe are they that have come through great tribulation,</hi> it's the Teſtimony given to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them, in ſome period of their life or other, they have had ſome ſignal Tribulation, and the Scripture tells us <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him:</hi> So the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſecures againſt all theſe, againſt the Curſe and Sting of the Croſs, againſt a diſproportioned Croſs to our ſtrength, and ſtrength under it, and the way to the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider that ſometimes the Croſs is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as a manifeſtation may be, however indeed we would be ay at carving out our own cordials, and like children, would have our handfull, and our ſenſe and our eye filled; yet the Croſs may be as neceſſary as the great priviledges of the Covenant, therefore ye find ſometimes the Croſs made a Promiſe, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.6. <hi>I will hedge up my way with thorns, and make a wall that ſhe ſhall not find her paths:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>And ſhe ſhall follow after her lovers. and ſhall not overtake them: and ſhe ſhall ſeek them, and ſhall not find them;</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43047:41"/>the reſult is, then ſhall ye ſay, <hi>I will go and return to my firſt Husband, for then it was better with me than now.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time <hi>David</hi> ſung this Song in the Pſalms, eſpecially <hi>Pſal,</hi> 119. <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes: Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word:</hi> Therefore it is not inconſiſtent with the Grace of the Covenant, that there be imperfect Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the Croſs in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. The laſt Difficulty that I would remove is, that it's a Covenant of pure and perfect Grace, Might it not remove our fears, though it keep us under imperfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Croſs? However the Covenant had not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us up above affliction, would it not have been a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of perfect Grace, if it had done this alms deed, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Elect againſt their fears, eſpecially ſince they are not only fears of ſin, but fears of Hell, and ſervile, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent fears?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> for anſwer to this, I will offer you theſe three things. 1. The Covenant hath done as much againſt fears, as was neceſſary to it, for the Covenant hath declared ſervile fear to be ſin, and hath expreſly forbidden them; it's ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the reprobat, <hi>they ſhall be in fear where no fear is:</hi> The Covenant often quarrels for them, <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</hi> So the Covenant condemns theſe ſervile fears, and quarrels for them, as a plague inflicted on the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. 2. Take notice, that a multitude of theſe fears, they ordinarly come on Believers, when they are furtheſt out of ſight of the Covenant, they forget the Covenant: the great ground of theſe fears is, from their reading the Covenant of Works, when they ſhould read the Covenant of Grace; it's not from the Covenant of Grace that they have theſe fears, for the anſwer of theſe fears is from the Covenant; the great ground why Believers are ſwallowed up with theſe fears, is, becauſe they underſtand not the Doctrine of the Covenant, or if they underſtand it, they forget it. 3. To ſay no more, ye ſhall know that the Covenant holds out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, even againſt theſe fears; thou may poſſibly have a plaiſter lying beſide thee for a ſore, and if ye lay it not on, it cannot cure: There may be fears on thee, and there lies in the Bible, in the room thou lies in, a plaiſter of the Covenant, that would remeed and cure theſe fears, but thou
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43047:42"/>lays it not to, therefore the pain continues; ſeveral times it's the not applying the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and not the want of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that makes the pain continue. Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man Mr. <hi>Dickson,</hi> hath written a Book <hi>Therapeutica,</hi> the Title of it is, <hi>The curing of all diſeaſes,</hi> by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> For uſe of the Doctrine, the conſideration of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, I confeſs it's the greateſt encouragement, if we were going to ly down in the Grave, that I could imagine, therefore hearken a little to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of it, and I would direct the improving of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace to three ſorts of perſons. 1. There are ſome Beginners, that have never to this day known, what a perſonal <hi>Covenant</hi> with God was; and readily they may be at this, O! I hear of ſo great things in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> there is <hi>wine, milk, honey, eye-ſalve, gold, fine linen, ſpices,</hi> and I have heard, that God cannot make greater Promiſes; and to ſpeak with reverence, It's impoſſible for him to make grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſhall the like of me, a poor ignorant polluted thing, make a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him? I confeſs thou had reaſoned well, if thou had been under a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works, but ſince thou art under a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, I will ſay but theſe three things to thee. 1. If thou will go home this night, and give him thy hand, and Indenture with him, to be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, though thou haſt no money, all theſe things ſhall be given thee, <hi>without money and without price.</hi> 2. I will ſay more to thee, though thou haſt <hi>played the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me.</hi> Nay 3. I will ſay yet more to thee, whatever thy guiltineſs hath been, and though thou has been a tranſgreſſor from the womb, yet if thou wilt yet go, and ſeriouſly indenture with him, and enter in a perſonal <hi>Covenant</hi> for the time to come, all former by-gones ſhall be by-gones, and thy want of money, and want of price to give for all theſe things, ſhall be no hinderance to thee and the great reaſon I give for this, it is a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace therefore go and indenture with him, and take the tide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it, it may be the Maſter riſe and cloſe the door on you and if ye be found without, and go down to the Grave on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of theſe days, ye may meet with, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not:</hi> therefore take the tide ſo long as the Mercat laſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and go and engage in this <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43047:42"/>
            <p>A ſecond ſort it ſpeaks to, if it be a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, it ſpeaks a word of reproof to you, that do not notice and take it up as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; and there are three ſorts that take it not up ſo. 1. There are ſome that would take up the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace for a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Liberty and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs; indeed it's a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, but not of Liberty, and thou that wilt go and neglect Prayer, and be a ſtranger to all the acts of fellowſhip with God, and of Grace, and will go follow thy Luſts, and will talk of a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace, thou calls it a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Liberty, and of all Creatures he will be angry with, and be avenged of, it will be thou. 2. It reproves theſe that never will deal with God by way of a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, but by way of a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works, ay when they come to him, they would ay have money in their hand, to give for the <hi>wine, milk, and honey;</hi> proud man cannot endure to hold of free Grace: of all the Doctrines of the World, it hath been moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church, <hi>Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, Lutherians,</hi> they become generally enemies to it. 3. It reproves theſe, that though they acknowledge it to be a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, and without merit, and alluring motive, yet they would have it a <hi>Covenant</hi> of a mixed nature, they would have ſome mixtures of ſome things of their own, in with the Grace of God: therefore they go conſtantly trembling, alas, I have ſuch a heart, and ſuch a way, I have no love to God, nor delight in him, therefore they will caſt away hope, as if the <hi>Covenant</hi> were a <hi>Covenant,</hi> partly of Grace, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Works, no, it's a <hi>Covenant</hi> of pure and unmixed Grace, it's a <hi>Covenant</hi> of perfect and full Grace, it's a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of perſevering and continuing Grace; now go not to turn it into a <hi>Covenant</hi> of another nature: But ſince the Father hath reſolved to exalt Chriſt and his Grace, ſubſcribe to the Tenor of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ſerves to preſs Believers to make uſe of it, as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; I will tell you three or four things, wherein I will eſpecially preſs you to make uſe of it as a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace. 1. If ye have any great thing to ſeek from God, may be ſome have a Temporal thing to ſeek from him, they have a ſtrait to come thorow; may be ſome have a Spiritual thing to ſeek, they have committed a ſin, and would have pardon for it, and they can ſcarcely expect that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43047:43"/>God will hear them; take up this Covenant as a Covenant of Grace, it is the nature of this Covenant, to give Pardon freely, <hi>without money, and without price;</hi> and if ye go to him and ſay, Lord, bring me out of ſuch a ſtrait, Lord, forgive me ſuch a ſin, and ye think ye will not be heard, why? I have no money to give for it; but let the Papiſts give their Pardons, it's not ſo in this Covenant. 2. Make uſe of it in anſwering all challenges, I will have occaſion when I come to that, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> To let you ſee, how the Covenant anſwers challenges, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it's the thing that makes many Chriſtians ſpend the moſt part of their Religion in complaints, they are either ignorant, or forgetful of the Covenant. 3. Improve it in all external difficulties; In a word, there is no caſe, no incident caſe, no challenge, no difficulty, no petition, we carry to God, but the conſideration of the Covenant, and of all the Promiſes of it, as an Act of free favour and Grace, may be eminently uſeful to them. Learn all of you to take it up as a Covenant of Grace; and take heed, when God hath given you a Covenant of Grace, and the Mediator hath purchaſed it, that ye deal not ordinarly with your ſelf, as if ye were under a Covenant of Works.</p>

            <p>I Propoſed in this Verſe five particulars to be handled; Firſt, The nature of <hi>David</hi>'s ſecurity, it's a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I have ſpoken to this in ſome preceeding Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and I purpoſed to dwell no more on it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the ſecond Branch of the Words, The Parties among whom this Covenant is Tranſacted, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant:</hi> That I may the better reach what is comprehended in this Branch of the Verſe, I deſire
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43047:43"/>may take notice of four particulars in it. 1. Ye have the Author and efficient cauſe of this Covenant, <hi>The Lord hath made,</hi> He doeth not ſay, I have made with the Lord, but <hi>the Lord hath made with me a Covenant.</hi> 2. Ye have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned in this Covenant, the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>me.</hi> 3. I ſhall take notice of the particulars, and perſonal way of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, or expreſſing theſe Parties; he ſays not, the Lord, and Chriſt, and the Lord and all the Elect, have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but the Lord hath made with <hi>me perſonally. Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall take notice of the Aſſurance, which his confident aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of it imports, he can affirm it with a deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a thing he is perſwaded of, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant:</hi> Theſe four ly all in the Text.</p>
            <p>The firſt particular holds out the Author of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Lord is the Maker of it, as he is the maker of Heaven and of Earth, ſo it is he that made the Covenant; the word is Emphatick in the Hebrew, it's true, it's not the proper word that ſignifies to creat; yet ſome Criticks think, it's ſometimes uſed for creation, <hi>The Lord hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with me a Covenant,</hi> yet I take it as it's rendred in our Tranſlation, and in this Sermon I will ſpeak a little to this Doctrine, Though <hi>the benefit of the Covenant redound to us, yet we were not the makers of it, but God made it;</hi> it has the ſmell of his Hand in it, and the making of it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture aſcribed to him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of David. Jer.</hi> 31.31. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in theſe days, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah, not according to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I made with their Fathers, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; but this ſhall be the covenant, after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Conſtantly throughout the Scripture, the making of the Covenant, he takes it to himſelf as the Author of it, and the efficient cauſe of it; this Branch of the Verſe is conſiderable, for the truth is, we had no hand in the making of the Covenant of Grace, it was allanerly himſelf, the Lord made it with me.</p>
            <p>That I may clear this Branch a little to you, I will dwell
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43047:44"/>on theſe three things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall enquire into what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Covenant may be ſaid to be made by the Lord. 2. I ſhall give you ſome Grounds to evince, that in all theſe reſpects, that it was made, and only could be made by him. And 3. ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Firſt, In what reſpects the Covenant may be ſaid to be made by the Lord, I ſhall deſire that ye may notice theſe four or five particulars here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The contrivement of the Covenant in all the Heads, Clauſes and Articles of it, was allanerly from him, it was he that contrived it in all the Clauſes, and Articles of it; the truth is, it contains a deſign very ſuitable to his Wiſdom, if ye will take a view of three myſteries into it, ye will find it proceed from the depth of infinit. Wiſdom. 1. If ye will take a view of the Truths in it, O! ſuch ſtrange Truths, one Perſon to be both God and Man, How difficult was that to reconcile? He was <hi>Maries</hi> Son, yet <hi>Maries</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that he was <hi>David</hi>'s Son, yet <hi>David</hi>'s Lord; What a ſtrange Myſtery is that in the Covenant, that Chriſt ſhould be altogether free of ſin, and yet juſtly ſuffer for ſin? The great Myſteries in the Covenant, in reference to the Truths holden out in it, evidence that the contrivement of it, could only proceed from God. 2. If ye will take a view, not of the Truths only, but of the Duties required in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; What a number of ſtrange Duties are contained in it, that would never have entred into the heart of Man? <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilius,</hi> that gave Laws to the <hi>Romans, Lycurgus</hi> that gave Laws to the <hi>Lacedemonians, Solon</hi> that gave Laws to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> their Laws never dreamed of Believing, and being ſaved by anothers Righteouſneſs; ſuch Duties, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of the Croſs, denying our ſelves, walking by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtrength, and doing all that we do, by a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Would ever Natures Light have reached theſe Duties of the Covenant? So take a view of theſe, and ye will find that the contrivement of it could only come from God. 3. Take a view of the Perſons admitted to the Covenant, if we had a ſecret to communicat, readily we would chuſe, not the ſimple, or the fooliſh, or babes, to communicat it to, we would pitch on the Learned, on the wiſe, on the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but the Covenant is ſo contrived, that the Truths of it are the greateſt Myſteries; one Perſon to be both God and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43047:44"/>Man, and that Perſon to be both the Son and the Maker of his Mother, that the Duties of it are ſtrange, one to Live by anothers Righteouſneſs; and that all theſe things ſhould be revealed to babes, and things that are not, and that the learned, and wiſe, and prudent, ſhould be paſſed by; ſuch a contrivement, had it proceeded from any man or angel, it had juſtly been accounted the moſt ridiculous and ſtrange fancy in the World; as a famous Antient ſaid of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that if he were not perſwaded, it immediatly proceeded from God, it would be the Religion of any that ever he heard, that he would be furtheſt from Believing; therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is from God, for the contrivement of it, in all the myſtical Truths of it, in all the Duties it requires, and the perſons to whom theſe Duties and Truths are communicat, evidences it to be from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secordly,</hi> As the contrivement of the Covenant is from God, ſo the Terms of the Covenant are made by him, he not only hath made his own, but our Terms, before we were, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was, and in ſome reſpect, it was from Eternity, from Everlaſting, and before ever we were capable to give our conſent, he ordered both his own Terms and ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Readily ye will ſay, Was not this an injury to us, that he ſhould make the Covenant ſo, as to make our Terms, as well as his own?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwering this, ye may remember ſome Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths ago, I opened to you, That it was a Deſpotick Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſuch as is made betwixt Prince and Subject, Maſter and Servant, Land-lord and Tennents, that he is abſolute Lord, and hath power to give Laws. 2. Take notice, that Chriſt the Mediator hath repreſented us in the Covenant, and ſo we had him like a Commiſſioner in a Shire, having a Commiſſion to go to Parliament, and giving his Vote for the Shire, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents that Shire from whom he hath the Commiſſion: So we had a repreſentative, in the perſon of a Mediator in the Covenant. 3. The Terms are made ſo, as it was impoſſible to imagine them to be more to our advantage, could there be an eaſier Clauſe put in, than that we ſhould accept? This is is all that is required on our part, that we ſhall conſent; now ſince the coutrivement of the Covenant, and the Terms on which it runs, proceeds both from God, it may juſtly be ſaid, that he hath made the Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:43047:45"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He is ſaid to have made the Covenant, in regard the furniture for doing our part of the Covenant, proceeds alſo from him, whatever is neceſſary on his part, or our part, and the truth is, he ſtands on both ſides of the Covenant, engaged to furniſh what is neceſſary for the Elect; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is as much engaged, for performing their part of the Covenant, as his own; they are bound by the Covenant to repent, to believe, to walk humbly and holily; all the things that are Terms on their part, he is engaged to furniſh them; they could contribute no more to it, than as ye ſaw a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that takes a piece of clay, and divides it in two, and the one part of it he caſts it by, and caſts it in the gutter, and treads on it, and the other part he takes it home, he provides gold, and gilds it, and makes it fit to be ſet on a Princes Table; all the gilding was from the Potter, it was the potter that made the difference betwixt that piece and the other bit lying in the gutter; therefore ye find him ſo earneſt preſſing our conſent to the Covenant in the Goſpel, if that prevails not, he yokes to his Spirit, and never leaves them until he bring them to purpoſes and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and to ſubſcribe their names to the Covenant, and then he leads their hand, and helps their purpoſes and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. So he ſtands on his own ſide, for the great and precious things promiſed; and he ſtands on the Elects ſide for performing their Duties. So it may be juſtly ſaid of him, he is the Maker of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He may be ſaid to have made the Covenant, in regard the publication and revealing of the Covenant, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanerly is from him, for this end hath he appointed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be written, and hath ordained Miniſters to Explain them, that he may reveal the Covenant; nay all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and all the Learning in the world, would never have carried a man to dream of ſuch a Covenant, without immediat Revelation from God; the Light of Nature, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, though they lead us to God as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yet they do not lead us to the opening the meaning of the Covenant, the revealing of that is allanerly from him; ſo the Contrivement, the Terms, the Furniture, and the revealing of the Covenant is from him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The fixed perpetuity of the Covenant is alſo from him, ordinarly according to the nature of perſons, ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43047:45"/>are their Covenants, careleſs perſons, their particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt will eaſily make them break their Covenants, variable and changeable perſons; but an Eternal God, and an Eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the perpetuity of it is from him, he hath ſecured it ſo, as though we break to him, yet the Covenant remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth firm, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, for I am married to you:</hi> Harlotry divorces by the Law of God, which provides that in caſe of Adultery, the man and the wife ſhould be Divorced, and the Marriage-bond comes to be looſed by Adultery. All theſe five, evidence that the Covenant is made by him, and really, it adds a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to it, that the ſmell of his hand is in it; it adds a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, that he contrived it, and that he drew the Terms, both on his own and our ſide, that the Furniture, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it, and the Stability of it is from him.</p>
            <p>Now in reference to the Covenant, that all theſe are made by him, will appear by theſe two remarkable Grounds, 1. This Covenant could neither have been made by Men, nor Angels, therefore it was made allanerly by God. 1. It could not have been made by Men, for we are but of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and the Covenant is everlaſting; when this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made, Man was lapſed and fallen, it could not have entred in his heart to think, that God ſhould give his only Son for him, and make a Covenant of Grace with him on that ſcore; it was undoubtedly a ſurpriſal to <hi>Adam,</hi> and many Divines think, he underſtood it not at firſt what that meant, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent,</hi> It was revealed to him in a dark myſterious Type, and a promiſe of the Meſſiah; all the courſe that he took when he was fallen, was to run away from God, and hide himſelf, and to go and ſew Fig-tree Leafs together to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his nakedneſs, he was far from dreaming of making an everlaſting Covenant with him. Neither 2. Could this Covenant have been contrived by Angels, they are brought in, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. And doing it to this day, looking into this Myſtery, <hi>Which things the angels deſire to look into,</hi> they are excellent creatures indeed, and perfect in Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, but their Knowledge is not able to fathom the height, the length, the breadth, and depth of the Covenant, no, had the Angels been the Arbiters (for as excellent creatures as they are) of our diſtance, after the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43047:46"/>fall, it was beyond the reach of their capacity to dream of ſuch a Covenant, therefore when they heard of it, and when it was revealed to them, <hi>they pry into it, and looked into it,</hi> and were aſtoniſhed at ſuch a contrivement of a Covenant of Grace, ſo it was above the reach of Angels; and poor Man could not do it, for he could do nothing when he fell, but run away and hide himſelf, and ſcarce knew what the firſt promiſe of the Covenant was, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Covenant was made by God, (and I like the notion well) will appear from this, that there are three deſigns, that wiſe and good men have, in the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their buſineſs in the world, and the wiſdom that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, makes them drive theſe three deſigns, and ye will find, the Father driving all the three, in making the Covenant, which evidences, that it's an act ſuiting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Wiſdom, and that there is but ſome reſemblance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men of this Wiſdom. 1. Several times men deſign the exalting of their Children. 2. The magnifying of themſelves. 3. If they be good, the advantage of others, And there runs a deſign in the Covenant, ſuiting infinit Wiſdom, in reference to all theſe three. 1. Like a wiſe Father, the deſign of the Covenant is, the exalting of his Son, he intends indeed to have his Son great, From whom could the covenant come, that tends ſo much to exalt Chriſt, but from Chriſt's Father? it looks like the deſign of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſcope of the Covenant, the accompliſhment of it, tends ſo much to the exalting of his Son, all the Blood that runs in the Veins of the Covenant, ſeems all to drive at the exalting of him, he is the Mediator of the Covenant, the Surety of it, all the Promiſes of it, are the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his three Offices; any that will obſerve the ſcope of the Covenant, the exalting of the Son, may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it was the Father of the Son that made it. 2. The Father in his infinite Wiſdom, deſigned the exalting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; I deny not, but he might have been exalted in his Juſtice, and have taken other methods, and ways, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, than by making a Covenant of Grace, as he might have been exalted in his Power, Wiſdom, and Juſtice, if he had taken <hi>Noah</hi> to Heaven, when he drowned the old World, and then made another World; but the great thing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43047:46"/>wherein men are moſt exalted is, Goodneſs and Grace; we read of ſome that have Ruled Tyrannically, and when they were dying, they have been like a Candle put out, that leaves an ill ſmell behind it; there is nothing better than to be exalted in Goodneſs, and Grace, and there is no better way to do it, than that man ſhould fall, and that he ſhould give his Son to die for him, and to make a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, that he ſhal give him Peace with himſelf, and an deaven for all Eternity: So it looks like a <hi>Covenant</hi> made by him. 3. God being a Communicative Good, Good in himſelf, it's impoſſible for him not to communicat Good to others, as impoſſible as it's for the Sun, which is Light in it ſelf, not to communicat Light; therefore when God made the World, he behoved to make Man, that he might communicat the good of the World to him, he being a Communicative Good, his nature carries him to do good to others, and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> is ſo ordered, that there is no good that man can be capable of, but it's promiſed in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Now all theſe three declare that it was he that made the <hi>Covenant;</hi> becauſe it tends ſo much to the exalting of his Son, his Goodneſs and Grace, and his being a Communicative Good; I will not dwell more on this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I will only ſay ſome few things by way of uſe, that I may come to ſpeak of the Parties, <hi>The Lord hath made with me,</hi> ye ſee the nature of it, there are many practical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of it, that I cannot now dwell on; Only here, 1. How humble men ought to be, the greateſt ground of boaſting we have in the World, is the <hi>Covenant,</hi> but alas, we had no hand in it, nor yet the Angels, they could not have contrived it, and we are very far from it: O! but Chriſtians, whoſe greateſt Charter in all their Cheſt is, this <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> we ought to be be walking very humbly on this account, for we contribute not ſo much as a deſire unto it, not only did we not merit, or was there any allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring motive, but there was not ſo much as a Prayer for it, or did we ſpend a Tear for it, or had a ſigh or a groan for it? But <hi>the Lord hath made with me,</hi> he contrived it, and drew all the Articles of it, therefore go humbly, and walk as one, that in the thing wherein thou has the greateſt ground of joy that ever thou had, yet had no hand in the contrivement of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> 2. It puts you to admire
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43047:47"/>the unſearchable riches of this grace; will ye but ſometimes take a view of your caſe, when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and run away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Thickets to hide himſelf, and he and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were forfeited; Take a view of what ye have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by that fall, if the things that ye can tell of your ſelves were written on your Foreheads, ye would be forced to go to ſome corner, like an Owl, to flee to the deſart and hide your ſelves: But O! the breadth, the length, the depth, and the height of this Grace, that God will contrive the Covenant, and draw the Terms of it, and ſtand on both ſides of the Covenant, both on our part of the Covenant, and his part, and Redeem us; go home and fall down before him, and exalt him, that ever he condeſcended to make the Covenant; What would have been our lot, or whether would we have turned our ſelves, or whether would we have fled, or left our Glory, if we had not this Covenant to run to? Therefore go, and admire and praiſe him; It's a notable frame of Spirit, when things revealed in publick, carries perſons to a corner, with ſome ſuitable thoughts of what they have heard; and indeed we ſhould carry our Duties in privat, ſuitable to our Duties in publick: Praiſe him, who in ſuch a deſperat caſe, was content to make as Everlaſting Covenant with thee. 3. Here is great ground of encouragement, to you that are not yet brought under the bond of the Covenant, He that made the Covenant, and brought perſons under it, he chuſed whom he will, he chuſed a <hi>Jacob</hi> and not an <hi>Eſau,</hi> a <hi>Peter</hi> and not a <hi>Judas, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> he had not done ſo much ill as <hi>Paul</hi> had done before his converſion, <hi>Judas</hi> was preaching Chriſt, and was caſting out Devils, and was in Chriſt's company, yet <hi>Judas</hi> was left to betray him; <hi>Paul</hi> was penſecuting and blaſpheming Chriſt, and making havock of the Church, and yet an Elect Veſſel, to lift up his Name amongſt the Gentiles; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all of you that are without the Covenant, ſince he made it with a <hi>Paul,</hi> and not with a <hi>Judas,</hi> with a <hi>Jacob,</hi> and not with an <hi>Eſau,</hi> and yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was the elder brother, on this account keep up your hope, and go to him, and preſs him to bring you under the bond of the Covenant, for what brought in <hi>Jacob,</hi> a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Peter,</hi> into the Covenant, but his own Grace? <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Was it he that was the Author and Maker of the Covenant? Then behold, amongſt all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43047:47"/>the things that ever he did, ſince he created the World, it's the thing that contributes moſt to exalt him, it was a great Work for him to ſay, <hi>Let there be light, and it was light,</hi> and for him <hi>to ſtretch out the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> and to make an Earth, as it were to hang on no foundation, and the circumference of Heaven about it, all theſe were great Declarations of the Greatneſs and Power of God; but all of theſe may ſtoop to this, that he has made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, who in one Perſon is both God and Man, and on the foundation of this Myſtery, hath founded ſo many Duties, and great Priviledges, that if himſelf had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them, they would appear the greateſt fancies in the World, and they that do not believe what he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, counts them all Phanaticks that credits them; but here is the greateſt demonſtration of Grace that ever he gave, that he hath <hi>ordered a Covenant,</hi> and contrived it, and made it ſo ſecure, that no breach on our part ſhall break the Covenant, and he is bound for our part of the Covenant, as well as his own, and he is engaged for our conſent, and when we come to ſubſcribe the Covenant, He will lead our hand; Can any imagine ſuch a Declaration of Grace? O! be ye aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, at the length, and breadth, and depth of this Grace, and Power, and Love.</p>
            <p>But I will cloſe all, with ſaying three things about his making the Covenant. 1. If there had any advantage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to him by making the Covenant, it had not been ſo ſtrange, I confeſs there is a Declarative Glory; like a man that comes to ſuch a ſpring of Water, and then he commends it, but he infuſes no new quality into the Well; all that we can do, adds nothing to his Eſſential Glory; now, it's ſtrange that he ſhould make ſuch a Covenant, and that all the advantage ſhould redound to us, and not to him, except what is Declarative. 2. The damned Angels they had many grounds to have pleaded a Covenant with him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we, they were more noble Creatures, and whatever was their ſin, it is generally thought to be pride, though it be difficult for us to determine, for they aſpired to be as God, ſo we are guilty of the ſame ſin, the Serpent tempted <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the Apple, and be like God, and ſo we were guilty of the ſame ſin, the Angels were guilty of. Now, that he ſhould make a Covenant with thee, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43047:48"/>not with them, is ſtrange. 3. The foundation of this Covenant, (and there was no other poſſibility of making it, in the ſtrain it runs on,) it was to be laid in the Blood of his Son; O! how many ways would man have taken, to have ſhifted the bargain, if the bargain could have ſtood no other way, but on the Blood of their Children; yea though the advantage was all to be ours, and we were as ill deſerving as the Devils, and that he ſaw there could not be ſuch a bargain driven, for our pardon, our peace, and our Heaven, but it behoved to be laid on the Blood of his Son; yet he drew the Covenant, contrived it, as it is this day. O! ye ſhould pray, that ye may be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the height, the length, the breadth, and depth of ſuch a Covenant.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The general conſideration of this, I will not dwell on it, I have ſpoken ſeveral things when I entred on the Verſe, of the Lords condeſcendency to make a Covenant with the Elect, only I would have you notice four things about it. 1. The Name <hi>Lord,</hi> it is here not to be taken Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but Eſſentially, as including all the three Perſons of the Trinity, ſo that in effect, in making the everlaſting Covenant, all the Perſons in the Trinity became our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Parties, each of them have their diſtinct Work in fulfilling the Covenant; the Father hath his Work, the Son hath his, and the Spirit hath his work; and the truth is, when we Covenant with God, ſo far as we can reach, there ought to be a diſtinct eye had to each Perſon of the Trinity, who though they be One in Eſſence, yet there are three diſtinct Perſons. M. <hi>Durham</hi> in his Treatiſe on the Revelation, makes a queſtion, which I will not determine, Whether in Prayer, <hi>a Chriſtian be obliged to eye diſtinctly every Perſon of the Trinity?</hi> But ſure I am, in Covenanting with God, ſince we find diſtinct actings aſcribed to the Father, Son, and Spirit, in the Covenant there is great need, to eye the ſeveral Bleſſed Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity; the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is common to them all, ſo that in effect, <hi>David</hi>'s party with whom he Covenanted, when this everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made, it was not the Father, or the Son Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally conſidered, but all the Perſons of the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, each of them in the Covenant; as they have their diſtinct works and operations, in bringing the Elect to Glory; ſo they all become Debtors to their own Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for accompliſhing the things of the Covenant, which they made with <hi>David.</hi> 2. Take notice, that this taking up of God eſſentially, the <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as ordinarly the Name is uſed by the word <hi>Jah,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.4 <hi>Extol him that rides on the Heavens by his name Jah,</hi> which is a Compend of the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, the taking him up under this name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> holds him out, as not only Faithful and True to his Promiſe in the Covenant, but as abundantly able to accompliſh his Promiſe in the Covenant: It's very pleaſant to conſider the Parties that made the Covenant, all the three Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, holden out under the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> thou that hangs by the Promiſe in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43047:49"/>
               <hi>Covenant,</hi> why goeſt thou with thy hands on thy loins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly moving diſcouraging Queſtions, and ſaying, <hi>One day or another I ſhall fall by the hand of Saul,</hi> Is not the Party <hi>Covenanting Jehovah?</hi> Is he not known to thee by the name <hi>Jehovah?</hi> He was not ſo known by the Tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> It's remarkable in the beginning of the Belief, the firſt Article of it, <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty;</hi> He is not like a Father, <hi>If his child ask bread of him, he will give him a ſtone;</hi> for he is a Father that will not beguile you; but many Fathers are not willing, nor able though they be willing, but he is both able and willing to help, he is <hi>Almighty;</hi> It's a remarkable beginning of the Commands, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage;</hi> I am the Lord God, I am <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the taking him up thus as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is a neceſſary conſideration; <hi>David</hi> made many <hi>Covenants</hi> with Princes that were about him, and he made many <hi>Covenants</hi> with his Subjects, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made one like this, <hi>the Lord hath made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant.</hi> But 2. The taking of him up under this name, the <hi>Lord,</hi> and conſidering this <hi>Covenant</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is indeed aſtoniſhing, that he ſhould have made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with men; take but a view of theſe three or four things, and ye will find, that <hi>the Lord and me,</hi> to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Covenant</hi> together, is exceeding ſtrange.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider that he is the God that gave Man, (who was lately nothing) a Beeing, O! they are words of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he comforts his Church in a ſad caſe with, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Thy Maker is thy Husband:</hi> Ye heard, it was a myſtery in the <hi>Covenant, Maries Son, yet Maries Maker:</hi> It is no leſs a myſtery, <hi>a Husband, and yet our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> to make us, and then to marry us, is it not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? And that is imported in, <hi>The Lord hath made with me.</hi> 2. If ye conſider, that by vertue of his creating, he had a Right of Dominion; he needed no more but Command, and Threaten, for he being our Maker, and Preſerver, he needed no more, he had a right to Command and Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; he needed ſay no more, but <hi>do not eat of the tree, for is the day thou eats thou ſhalt die,</hi> as he did with the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but that he ſhould lay by his Dominion, and come as we were equals, and treat a <hi>Covenant,</hi> nay, when it was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Perſon that repreſented us, was his equal, he was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43047:49"/>the Man that was his <hi>Fellow, and thought it to robbery to be equal with God, Philip.</hi> 2. Now that he ſhould treat a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with us, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> how ſtrange was this, ſince the Parties were not equal? 3. Had it been a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works he had treated, it had ſuited ſome way to a Command and Threatning; but to treat ſuch a <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> with us, is wonderful; Who of us would take a Dog, or a Worm, and Indenture with it, to give it our own Bed, and in a manner prefer it to our own Children? The truth is, he ſeemed to do this, when, <hi>that we might be healed, he laid the ſtripes on him, he was made a curſe, that we might be made righteous; he was made ſin, that we might be holy.</hi> But <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> was made with lapſed Man; he could not promiſe to himſelf from us, the thing he could promiſe from <hi>Adam;</hi> for however <hi>Adam</hi> was under a poſſibility of falling, yet that was all, it ſeemed very improbable, that ſo light a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation would make him break the <hi>Covenant</hi> that he had made with God, <hi>but the imaginations of our hearts are evil continually;</hi> it is ſince he made that <hi>Covenant,</hi> frequently the complaint is, <hi>I am preſsed under with their iniquities, as a cart is preſsed under with ſheaves.</hi> And, <hi>I am broken with their whoriſh heart;</hi> So conſider his being our Maſter, and conſider the Dominion he had on that account; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the <hi>Covenant</hi> is made with lapſed Man, and that it is a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; it is in effect one of the greateſt wonders in the Bible, <hi>The Lord hath made with me,</hi> &amp;c. O! learn to admire the condeſcendency of Grace, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we are not oftner telling it to others, and that we ſpend not more time when we meet, in diſcourſing of it; but this general I will not inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>I will conſider this tranſaction of the <hi>Covenant</hi> perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more particularly it's remarkable, <hi>David</hi> doeth not ſay, he made with the Elect, whereof I am one; or he made with the Church, whereof I am a member, but the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting <hi>Covenant;</hi> he takes it and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes it perſonally to himſelf. I had long time a deſign to ſpeak to this Head of perſonal <hi>Covenanting</hi> with God; I judge it one of the great duties of the Goſpel, and that which will contribute as much to lay a reſtraint on ſin, and to excite to duties, as any mean that a Chriſtian can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43047:50"/>therefore I intend to dwell ſome Sermons on it, I ſhall make ſome entry on it now, and ſhall take this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. That <hi>though the Covenant of Grace be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made with the Mediator, and with the Elect, yet every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſhould make it perſonally;</hi> they ſhould be at, <hi>the Lord made with me:</hi> It's remarkable, when God firſt entred in this everlaſting Covenant, he indeed publiſhed it generally to all the ſeed of the Woman, that is, to all the Elect, who were comprehended under the Mediator, who was the ſeed of the Woman, and not of the Man, yet afterward ye find it is perſonally made with <hi>Abraham, Pſal.</hi> 105. it's ſworn to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and confirmed to <hi>Iſaac</hi> with an oath, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it's particularly confirmed to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and here it's renewed to <hi>David,</hi> it's indeed a general Covenant made with the Mediator, for all his Members, yet often ye find God treating it with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and again, it is not enough it be made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but he muſt treat it with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and confirm it with an Oath, and over again, he muſt treat it with <hi>Jacob,</hi> importing, he muſt not only make it with the Fathers, but with their Children: there are many that he hath made a Covenant with their Father and Mother, but they are not in it themſelves; they can ſay, the Lord hath made an everlaſting Covenant, but they cannot ſay, the Lord hath made it <hi>with me,</hi> therefore the Lord will manage this Covenant, firſt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterward he will treat it perſonally with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and confirm it with an Oath, and renew it again with <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to follow this Head of Perſonal Covenanting with God, I would have you notice this Caution in the beginning of it,</p>
            <p>Caution, <hi>That the Covenant of Grace is but one Covenant, the ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, that God made with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob: We muſt not think there are as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Covenants, as there are diſtinct perſons, that enters in that Covenant; there is but one Sun, and every one may have enough of light from that one Sun, and a Ray of that Sun comes in at his own Window, if he caſt open a Broad of his Window, though it be the common Sun, that ſerves all the Kingdoms of the earth: So, it's the ſame general Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with the Mediator, every particular perſon is to open his Window-broad, and let in a ſuitable Ray of that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43047:50"/>Covenant to his caſe, and particularly and perſonally apply it to himſelf. We are not to think, as <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, that God hath made a general Covenant with all the Elect; but for particular perſons, he hath left a blank to be filled up, when they believe and repent; they ſay this ſame of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, they make general acts of Grace to be conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally accompliſhed; eſpecially, if they believe the Lord, when he indented the everlaſting Covenant, he ſet down not only <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s name, but thy name, if thou wilt conſent; Nay, what do I ſay, if thou conſent, he filled up thy name being an Elect, and engaged to effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at thy conſent; ſo we are not to think, that there are as many Covenants as there are diſtinct perſons; it's one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Covenant, like as it is one Sun that affords light to all the World, yet every Believer and Elect, is perſonally to Indent for himſelf, and to apply the Covenant, and to apply the promiſes on the Fathers part, but he hath bound himſelf to the duties of the Covenant on his part.</p>
            <p>And in the general, this perſonal Covenanting takes in three things; I confeſs, the third of them is not a proper act of Covenanting, yet it is neceſſary to the making of it up. (1) A perſon in making this Covenant, is either ſaying or ſubſcribing, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s word is, <hi>One ſhall ſay, and another ſubſcribe himſelf to be the Lords;</hi> whatever be the way of it, ſometime one will do it with ſaying, ſometime one will do it by ſubſcribing, or ſometime one will do it with lifting up their hand to God, that the ſolemnity may be the greater; in their indenturing in this perſonal Covenant with God, the tenor of what they do is, I accept this Chriſt on theſe terms, he offers me Wine, Milk, Honey, without money, and without price; he offers me fine Gold, I accept of the offer, and I give my conſent, I will either write it down, or give it under my hand, I will ſay it, or I will do it, by lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of my hand to the Lord. (2.) The perſon that thus perſonally Covenants, or that is about to draw the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Covenant of Grace, to his caſe, ſubſcribes to the duties of the Covenant, particularly to give himſelf to the Lord, <hi>One ſhall ſay, and another ſubſcribe with his hand, I am the Lords:</hi> It's remarkable, ſince God in the Covenant gives himſelf to us, he will accept of nothing from us but our ſelves again; when we ſubſcribe to give our ſelves to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43047:51"/>Lord, we ſubſcribe to this, Lord, diſpoſe of me as thou wilt, croſs me or humble me as thou wilt, for I give it under my hand, that I am thy diſpoſing; it's true, we bind to all the duties of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> likewiſe I deny not, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may find their temptations miſcarry them, in reference to ſome ſins; ſome are led away with ill company, and made to ſwear, ſome are tempted to drunkenneſs; I deny not, but they may either <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, or particularly bind againſt that, wherein their greateſt temptations and weakneſſes lyes; if perſons find themſelves negligent in Prayer, of that the leaſt wag of their neighbour coming, will call them from their duty to God, though they are in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to bind to all the duries of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> yet we are particularly to bind, where our temptations are greateſt, and where our weakneſs is greateſt: Perſonal <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting</hi> with God, ought to run moſt on that Head, which may prove an excellent reſtraint to the ſoul, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hinderance to the corruption, which the heart is drawn to, with any light temptation: ſo this perſonal <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with God, when we can ſay, <hi>the Lord hath made with me a Covenant,</hi> though the Lord hath made the <hi>Covenant</hi> in general with Chriſt, and all the Elect, and though he hath viſibly appeared to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though he hath not ſo viſibly appeared to <hi>David,</hi> yet he hath his own way of communication, and we enter in a perſonal <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, when we go, and either with our voice, or with our hand ſubſcribe it on Paper, or with lifting up the hand ſolemnly, when we are in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame in Prayer, and we do this, when we accept of the offer of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and of the Mediator, on the terms of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and binds our ſelves to the duties of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as we are moſt negligent of, and ſooneſt led away from: There lyes the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal <hi>covenanting</hi> with God, eſpecially, if ye add, as a Cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. (3.) When the ſoul engages to theſe two, that it caſt an eye to the Treaſurer, unto whom the Father hath committed the bearing of the Purſe: The Truth is, our <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting</hi> with him, is like <hi>Deliab</hi>'s binding <hi>Sampſon</hi> with cords, ſo long as ſhe cuts not his locks, his ſtrengthremains, but when his locks are cut, he is weak. When we can an eye to the Treaſurer in our <hi>covenanting,</hi> we are ſtrong; but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43047:51"/>when we eye him not, we are weak: It's ſuppoſed <hi>Adam</hi> when he was perfect, ſtood not above five hours, and what can lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man do? Therefore the Covenant takes in the accepting of the offer, and binding to the duties, but both to be done through the Mediator, and if this be neglected, it is not right covenanting; And I believe it lyes at the root of much of our covenanting, and many lave challenges in their covenanting with God, that they have not eyed the Mediator, and gone to the Fountain and Treaſurer, out of which their ſtrength both for accepting and binding muſt come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ye will ſay, I have opened in this Covenant perſonal and particular covenanting, but what if God make not a Covenant with me, or if I make a Covenant, with him, how ſhall I know if he makes a Covenant with me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For Anſwer to this, I ſhall only ſay theſe two things, (1.) God in making perſonal Covenants with men, had very different ways of communication of himſelf; when he made the Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> he ſpake with him face to face, he did ſo to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but he did not ſo to <hi>David,</hi> but he ſends a Prophet to him; it were unreaſonable he ſhould do ſo to every body; there were many Worthies under the Old Teſtament, that could ſay, <hi>the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> and God did not come down and ſpeak face to face with them, and confer with them, and ſay, this is my promiſe; it were I ſay unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable he ſhould do ſo to us, for though the Covenant be not ſo ſenſible as it was to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> it may come to thee, as it did to <hi>David:</hi> So that we are not to expect he will take the ſame way with every one, that he brings under the bond of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>I will cloſe this Sermon, with exhorting you to ſtudy this perſonal covenanting with God, I indeed take it up, for the great duty of the Goſpel; I confefs, it's the great neglect of the generation that we live in, the generation coming may be more in the practice of it, that Maſters of Families will not take their Wives, Children and Servants, and enter in a Family-Covenant with them, and when they are in corners, would enter in a perſonal Covenant with him. I will only cloſe this diſcourſe of it, with naming three or four things, that I judge to be great hinderances in the way of Chriſtians perſonal covenanting with God. (1.) It is a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43047:52"/>great hinderance, our miſtaking the end of the Law, the Law is a School-Maſter to lend to Chriſt; and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if they come under a Law-word, they perſwarded, that they ſhould dwell on it, they cannot be perſwaded, that this drives at perſonal covenanting with him; ye will hear afterward, if ever there be a time of entering in a perſonal Covenant with God, of accepting the Covenant of the terms offered, it's when we are under a work of the Law: now many Chriſtians miſtake quite the end of the Law, they think their tears and humiliations, and Law-works, they are to dwell on them, and they know not that the Laws is a School-Maſter to lead them to Chriſt; the end of theſe fears is, to terrifie you to ſeek a ſhelter in the everlaſting Covenant. (2.) It hinders many to enter in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant perſonally, they are exceedingly afraid, that their guilt be greater, if they break; I conſfeſs it's juſtly to be feared, but that ſame Argument ſhould hinder thee from being Baptized, and from going to the Sacrament of the Supper, wherein thou renews a Covenant with him; the ſame Argument that hinders thee from covenanting with God, hinders thee from theſe two; but would ye think it a good arguing, if a man were like to drown in a Well, and one let down a Rope to him, and bid him take hold of the Rope, and it will bring him up; if he ſhould argue, I dare not take hold of the Rope, for fear when I near up the Rope break, and my fall be the greater? But I ſay, unleſs thou enter in a perſonal Covenant with God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Covenant of Grace, and apply it to thy caſe, thou art arguing, as the man in the Well, that will not take hold of the Rope, for fear when I am near up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> get the worſe fall. 3. It hinders ſome from covenanting with God, they would have ſome Arles in their hand, before they truſt him: ſaith one, I would Covenant with him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, if he would give me a fill of Senſe, and would take me to the Banqueting-houſe, and caſt his Banner over me, and give me that ſoul-delight that he gives to ſome; but they do not remember, it's a reflection on him, not to truſt him, without ſomething in hand. Take heed to this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and hang upon his promiſe, and if thou ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to ſing, the Lord hath filled my hand with ſende all my life, thou has a nobler ſong to ſing, <hi>The Lord hath
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43047:52"/>made with me an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> (4.) It hinders ſome from making a perſonal Covenant, they are afraid to lay bonds and tyes on them, and take away their mirth: O! it were a mercy if ſome of our profane young ones, that are filling the Town with profanity, and their Parents ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no notice of them, the moſt part of them begging the one half of the day, and profaning the Name of God the other, if they could be brought thus to Covenant with God: But many think that a great tye and a burden, that they ſhould be more in ſpeaking of Chriſt when they were in company, and may be thou can be in many companies, and never a word of him; or thou can mock at Prayer and Godlienſs, and may be it not challenge thee, but thou art afraid that perſonal covenanting bring a burden on thee. I will Anſwer all theſe, when I go thorow the point; I will ſay this of it, thou muſt either accept perſonally of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, on the terms that it's offered, and engage perſonally to the terms on which it's made, or then thou ſhalt never have any benefit by it. O? what a mercy were it, if when we come under ſome ſtrait, ſome ſickneſs, or when we get any looſing of heart at a Communion; nay, when we come under deſertion, the renewing of a Covenant may be the way to an out-gate. It's remarkable, when Chriſt was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on the Croſs, and the great cloud of his Fathers wrath hanging over his head, in a manner, he renews the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> If thou fall in any groſs ſin, go and renew the Covenant; if he command ſome ſignal ſtroke to attend thee, renew the Covenant: The great Objection is, it's a ſore matter to be ay binding, and ay breaking, and this is thy caſe readily. I confeſs it's a dreadful caſe, to be ay binding, and ay brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; yet notwithſtanding of all thy breaches, if thou wilt yet go and ſay, and ſubſcribe with thy hand, to be the Lords, and to be more to his praiſe; if thou be a neglecter of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fellowſhip, that thou ſhall ſpeir it out, ſpeir where thou ſhall get ſome to pray with, and put in that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant; if thou be negligent in Prayer, to lift up thy hand to be ſo no more: all former breaks will be all paſt, if thou can ſay with full purpoſe of heart, <hi>the Lord hath made with me an everlasting Covenant.</hi>

            <p>HAving ſpoken of the nature of <hi>David</hi>'s ſecurity, I came the laſt Sabbath to ſpeak of the Parties tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacting in this Covenant, <hi>The Lord and me,</hi> I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed four things to be noticed; <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Author of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Parties with whom the Covenant is made, and told you that that the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is to be taken eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as including all the Perſons of the Trinity, who are all Partiesin the Covenant, and each of them has their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar work, in the accompliſhing of the Covenant. But paſſing what was ſpoken, I come to that which I propoſed to dwell on this day, the particular Application of the Covenant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually and perſonally to <hi>David:</hi> It's no, the Lord hath made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor with the Elect, but, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I ſhall dwell on this day, ſhall be this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which natively ariſes from this Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> That <hi>however the Covenant externally and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be made with the whole viſible Church, and really with the Mediator, and through him with all the Elect, yet every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought perſonally, and particularly to Indenture in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and apply it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, the Covenant is offered to be Tranſacted with all the Members of the viſible Church, and really with all the Elect; yet every Believer, who would ſecure his intereſt in the contents and clauſes of the Covenant, is to inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perſonally, and particularly apply the Covenant to himſelf, as if it were made with them. This Truth hath a great deal of oppoſition in the world, <hi>Arminians,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians,</hi> who though they unite not in many things, they unite in oppoſition of this Truth, they deny perſonal and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43047:53"/>particular Covenanting with God; the generality of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and profane mockers, look on it as a fancy, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to Covenant with God; and the moſt part of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the viſible Church, ſatisfie themſelves with their Tranſactions in Baptiſm, and ſome external kind of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacting at the Sacrament of the Supper, but perſonally and really to indenture with God, on the Terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they utterly neglect; therefore, to follow this Truth, ſince it comes ſo directly in my way, I will inſiſt on theſe three things in following this head. 1. I ſhall labour to prove by ſome reaſons, that it is not only a warrantable, but a moſt neceſſary Duty, for Chriſtians to make perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and particular Covenants with God. 2. I ſhall open wherein this perſonal and particular Covenanting with him, doeth conſiſt. And 3. ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is not only warrantable but neceſſary, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and particularly to Covenant with God; for confirming of this, I will offer theſe five or ſix rational Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We have not only Scriptural practices of it, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of <hi>David,</hi> of whom this Text ſpeaks; whom we have frequently practiſing it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O my ſoul, thou hast ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my God.</hi> So we find <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> And then, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and on the earth that I deſire beſides thee?</hi> It was in effect a Covenant of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that <hi>Thomas</hi> entred into, when he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>thou art my Lord and my God.</hi> We have not only practices of it, but Propheſies of it, amongſt many Propheſies about it, for clearing and confirming it, I will read two, one of them ye have, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.5. <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords, and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of Jacob, and another ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with his hand to the Lord, and ſirname himſelf by the name of Iſrael,</hi> Mark here, ye have one, and one, and another; individually and indefinitly indenturing with God, and ye have the different way of their doing of it, one ſhall ſay, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand; ye have the ſame over again Propheſied, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength, even to him ſhall men come;</hi> here ye have theſe two Scriptural Propheſies, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the times of the Goſpel, wherein there ſhould be, a ſaying, and ſubſcribing with the hand, and it's no the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43047:54"/>Church in general, but <hi>one ſhall ſay, and another ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,</hi> it's a particalar and perſonal indenturing with God; I know not what a multitude of Scriptures I might multiply for the confirmation of this, that it's not only warrantable, but abſolutely neceſſary, it is the accompliſhment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and an imitation of the cloud of Witneſſes, who have gone before us in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Light of Nature teaches; that in mutual Tranſactions, that paſs betwixt Parties, about buſineſs of concernment, the Tranſaction ſhould be mannaged particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and perſonally; Natures Light teaches, that <hi>dolus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatur in generalibus,</hi> frequently this holds in this caſe, where there paſſes no indenturing betwixt God and the Soul, but meerly generals, readily the a ſurance of an intereſt in any Tranſaction by the Light of Nature, it's the ſurer and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the more particular mention be of the Parties concerned in ti; hardly is there a very ſmall buſineſs a man will Tranſaact with his neighbour, but he will be as diſtinct and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as he can, eſpecially if he know it be a thing will be ſubject to much debate in Low; is it not ſtrange, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould teach men to be ſo diſtinct, and particular in their ſmalleſt concernments, and yet they reſt on generals, contrair to the Light of Nature, in their greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? No, that ſame Light that leads men to be perſonal and particular, and diſtinct in mannaging all their other other affairs, in order to their clearing and aſſurance, leads them up in the buſineſs of their greateſt concernment, far more to be perſonal and diſtinct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All the fundamental Priviledges, are all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and perſonal, and why ought not the Covenant to be particularly and perſonally entred into? Election is not indefinit and univerſal, as <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> teach: no, it's neither univerſal nor conditional, it's abſolute and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; there is a certain number given by the Father to the ſon in Redemption, ſo it's no univerſal, nor indefinit, nor conditional Election; Adoption, Union with Chriſt, and all the reſt of the fundamental Priviledges, they run in this ſtream, to be particular and diſtinct, Why ought not the Covenant, which is as it were the Charter, by which we come to be ſecured of theſe fundamental Priviledges, to be alſo perſonal and diſtinct? Why ſhould our Election,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43047:54"/>Redemption, Adoption, and Effectual Calling, each of them be particular, and perſonal; and the Covenant, which is the Charter, and great ground of our ſecurity, not be particular and diſtinct alſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> On Gods part, whether we reſpect the abſolute Promiſes, or the conditional, they all point at particular perſons; <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, I will put my fear in their heart, and I will give them pardon of ſin;</hi> whatever promiſe be made, whether abſolute of conditional, they are not terminat, nor have their accompliſhment together, in the viſible Church, but like Water that is to be poured in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Bottle; now ſince on the Fathers part he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came debtor to every individual or perſonal Member, taken within the Covenant, Is it not only warrantable, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, that there ſhould be a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perſonal taking hold of the Covenant, in all theſe clauſes whether abſolute or conditional?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The duties of the Covenant are particularly and perſonally to be performed, there is none here can go a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare for another, none can pay anothers debt in the Covenant, every man muſt give an account for himſelf in this Covenant, the Parent cannot do for the Child, nor the Huſband for the Wife, but every man muſt do for himſelf; now fince every Duty muſt be performed particularly and perſonally, Is there not then and abſolute neceſſity, that there ſhould be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and perſonal indenturing with God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The nature of juſtifying Faith, which is the great condition of the Covenant, conſiſts in a particular and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal application of the Covenant; an Hiſtorical Faith will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Devils to believe, that Chriſt loved the Elect, and gave himſelf for them; but juſtifying Faith carries a <hi>Paul</hi> to, <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> herein lyes the nature of juſtifying Faith, it's a particular application of Chriſt and of the Covenant, in all the articles and caluſes of it; and there can be no right application by Faith, of the priviledges of the Covenant, without becoming ſubject to the duties of it, otherways, as in marriage, we would ſeparat what God hath joyned, we would ſeparat the promiſing and commanding part of the Covenant. Now lay all theſe ſix together, and I conceive, I have laid before you, moſt rational grounds, why the duty of perſonal Covenanting with God, is not only warrantable, but of abſolute neceſſity.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:43047:55"/>
            <p>The ſecond thing propoſed, ſhall be to open, wherein this Act of perſonal Covenanting with God conſiſts; ſome have dilated on it at a great length, and have dwelt on the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Acts to it, and the things formally required in the Act it ſelf, and there, have ſpoken of the Properties and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it; but I will not dwell on it at this length, yet that I may be helpful to you, in your perſonal Covenanting, in regard one of the great grounds of our withering and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reſults from the neglect of this Duty, I ſhall therefore inſiſt, in opening the nature of it, only in ſpeaking to theſe tgwo things, which I conceive will briefly ſum up, wherein this act of perſonal Covenanting conſiſts. I will not go to ſpeak any thing of Gods part, either when we make or renew the Covenant with him; But all I ſhall ſay now, ſhall be ſomething of our part, when we perſonally Covenant with him, I will reduce them to theſe two Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our perſonal Covnenating with God, conſiſts in our accepting of the offers of the Covenant, as they are made by God. 2. In our engaging to the Terms of the Covenant, required by God; for the Terms muſt be the Terms that he hath made in the Covenant; we muſt not make now Terms, neither muſt we reject any of the Terms already made: I deny not, as ye ſhall hear, when I come at it, but on the account of a particular failing, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may be more in engagin, with reſpect to one things, than another, eſpecially where he hath failed moſt, and Conſcience doeth challenge him moſt; but we are neither to make new Terms, nor reject the Terms already made, in our perſonal Covenanting with God, we muſt keep to the Terms already made and propoſed in the Covenant, in all the Articlaes and Clauſes of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, It conſiſts in the accepting of the offer of the Father, made in the Covenant: I confeſs, I like well to read the excellent Soliloquies, many have had with their own Souls, in the accepting of this offer, and entring in this Covenant; ye have patterns of them ſet down, Mr. <hi>Allan</hi> in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae Pietatis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Saints Reſt;</hi> It's like theſe holy mens ſouls, when they have been Tranſacting this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant with God, they have been in a very elevated frame, they ſpeak part of the Language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> What Apoſtrophies, and what turnings to their own ſoul, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43047:55"/>what excitements and encouragements they offer to the ſoul? and then cloſes with either, <hi>I accept this Covenant, or this contrivement of the ſalvation of ſinners, as it is offered:</hi> or elſe readily, <hi>I ſwear and ſubſcribe it with my hand.</hi> or elſe <hi>I lift up my hand.</hi> Mr. <hi>Allan</hi> approves for ſome length of the lifting up of the hand, that the ſolemnity may be the more binding, in the accepting of the Covenant, and of the Terms offered in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>But here I will offer you two things about this accepting of the Covenant, which is the firſt thing wherein this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal act of perſonal Covenanting conſiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take notice, that this acceptation, if it be done cordially, ſeriouſly, deliberatly, and according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; it's a moſt difficult thing, it's not an eaſie thing to bring the heart to it; I will not ſay this for the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of any, but there are three things that makes it moſt difficult. 1. There is no ſeed of Believing naturally in man; <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> have obſerved, that it is a moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing, to bring Creatures to act about a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have no principle within them; How difficult is it, to Teach Philoſophy or Reaſon to Bruits? And the great ground of it, is they have no feed or principle of it within them, and this makes the accepting of the offer of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to be a thing moſt difficult. 2. In the accepting of this Covenant, not only have they no ſeed of Believing in them, but all the principles in man are contrair to it; It's a wonder to ſee how proud man repines, to accept of an imputed Righteouſneſs; ye will find in the Church, <hi>Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians;</hi> and I know not what a multitude of them, crying down Juſtification by Faith alone, and mocking at the Term of an imputed Righteouſneſs; and O! that there were not too many amongſt our ſelves, running headlong to theſe principles. 3. The difficulty of it will appear, if ye conſider the oppoſition that it meets with in the World, in accepting this imputed Righteouſneſs, How many oppoſitions did Chriſt himſelf meet with, when he was among men? It was conſtantly his work, to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this, yet when he came to his own, even amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> they required a ſign, before they accepted it: and when he was preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they required Arguments and Demonſtrations, ere they accepted it; in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43047:56"/>effect, man having no principle within him, for accepting this Righteouſneſs, and all the principles within him being contrair to it, and Chriſt himſelf having met with ſo much oppoſition when he preached it, ye may conclude from theſe, that it's not an eaſie thing to perſwade a ſinner to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this Righteouſneſs of the Covenant. But I will add another thing, that this Act of accepting, it's one ſpecial part of that, wherein perſonal Covenanting conſiſts; and for clearing of this, I would have you to notice three things. 1. Ye ſhall take notice, that God in the Covenant of Grace, he hath as it were, paſt from the Terms of the Covenant of Works, no but he requires the ſame duties in the Covenant of Grace: I have already evinced it to you, that the whole Law, we become bound to obedience to it in the Covenant of Grace; yea, there are ſome Duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Covenant of Grace, that are not required in the Covenant of Works; yea, he hath bound us to the whole Law, in our accepting of this Righteouſneſs; I ſay, though he hath bound us to the Law. it's not the Law that is the great condition of the Covenant of Grace; it's not our obedience that is the great condition, it's our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and accepting of the offered Righteouſneſs; ſo that though obedience to the Law was the great condition of the Covenant of Works, the tenor and nature of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are exceeding different, and now the great condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the Law be required, the Law is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it's the accepting and imbracing the offered Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is neceſſary to be obſerved, in regard there are many precious to God, they deal with themſelves ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly, as if the Covenant of Grace run in the ſame channel, that the Covenant of Works run in, and if they have not the ſame perfection of obedience, and if our Sanctification have not ſuch and ſuch qualifications, and ſuch degrees, they utterly ſentence themſelves as caſt-aways; no, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is required in the Covenant of Grace, but the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the offered, Righteouſneſs, is the great condition of the Covenant of Grace. 2. Take notice, that this accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the offer, it's really and formally the very act of Believing; In perſonal Covenanting, it may be convenient, that <hi>one ſhould ſay, and another ſubſcribe with his hond;</hi> but the very act of accepting is, the act of Believing; ſo the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43047:56"/>Soul tranfacts with God in this part of the perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when it puts out an act of recumbency and relying on Jeſus Chriſt, as he is holden the out in Covenant; ſo, this is the great condition of the Covenant, and this accepting is the very formal and proper act of Believing. I add 3. This accepting is the ſpecial thing in perſonal Covenanting: I deny not, but the Terms, as ye ſhall hear, on which the offfer is made. are neceſſary to be eyed, and readily we make but a very ſuperficial bargain, that will make a faſhion of accepting the offer, and ſlight the Terms on which it's made; but he principal act in Covenanting is, to credit deliberatly, ſeriouſly, and effectually, the Grace that makes the offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and to rely and caſt our ſelves abſolutely over on him. I deny not but we are to give our ſelves to the Lord, and reſign our ſelves to be diſpoſed of by him, and to be engaged to Duties, according to our ſtation: but this is not the princinal part, the principal part is, to go to him, and ſay, This day, Lord, I accept of Chriſt, I accept of this Righteouſneſs, that he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; I will rely on it, and caſt my ſoul and hope of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. But I will not inſiſt in teaching you a form of words, that may be uſed in accepting of the offer; but as this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting is a difficult thing, there being no principle in man for it, but all againſt it, ſo the great condition in perſonal Covenanting is, this act of accepting.</p>
            <p>The other thing required in making up this perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God it's engaging to the Terms on which the offer is made; we cannot go perſonally to Covenant with God, but firſt we ſuſt accept of the offer, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture to the Terms; There are two or there things here, I thought to have ſpoken a little unto. 1. To hold out to you, that ye may be the better directed in it, ſomething of the Terms, on which the offer is made, of their reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs and their excellency. 2. That though it be not the principal act in perſonal Covenanting, it's indiſpenſably neceſſary, and in effect there can be no perſonal Covenant, except we indenture to the Terms, and accept of the offer on the Terms.</p>

            <p>HOW excellent ſoever the Covenant of Grace be, and excellent it is, yet the Lord hath left a liberty in the viſible Church, for every man to come and put in his name into it, <hi>Ho, every one, and whoſoever will let him come, and take the waters of life freely.</hi> Without a curious inquiry, into the many things pre-required, or ſubſequent unto it; I reſolved the Anſwer in two Heads: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The accepting of the offer of the Covenant. 2. The indentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Terms of the Covenant, the accepting of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is the firſt and principal part, though the Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire other Duties, yet they are not the proper conditions of the Covenant and for leſs the firſt and prineipal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I ſhall ſay no more of that Branch of the act of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, the accepting of the offere.</p>
            <p>The other thing wherein it conſiſts is, the ſubmitting and indenturing for the Terms, on which the offer is made; and here there are two things that I would do. 1. I ſhall inquire a little, in helping to this act of perſomal Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with God, into what the Terms are. 2. What en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement the Soul hath to indenture for theſe Terms. notwithſtanding of their number and greatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What theſe Terms are, <hi>Antinomians</hi> will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any conditions in the Covenant; I will net deny, but if ye examine that word <hi>Condition</hi> properly, but they may have ſomething to ſay, but that there are Terms on which the offer is made, and which in the Souls Covenanting with God, muſt be indentured for, is beyond all controverſie; what theſe Terms are, is then worthy of inquiry; to run through them at large, would take a large time; I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention two things. 1. In perſonal Covenanting with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43047:57"/>God, there is ſomething we muſt give. <hi>2ly.</hi> There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we muſt do, and we muſt indenture for both what we are to give, and what we are to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are ſomethings we muſt give, and what is this, what have we to give? Had we the cattel on a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand mountains, and give we them, what would they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to Him? <hi>Shall we give the fruit of our body, for the ſin of our ſoul?</hi> no, we are to give Him our ſelf indeed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denturing on our part, is mainly lying in this, to make an abſolute reſignation of our ſelves to Him, as the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Paul</hi> bare them this teſtimony, and he thought it not ſtrange, that they were charitable, for they had <hi>given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Lord;</hi> the Lord in the Covenant, He gives Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and it's the leaſt we can do, to give our ſelves back again; it's a marriage Covenant, and it is not enough for the bride, that ſhe give ſuit and preſence, but that ſhe give her ſelf to her husband: It's reported in the life of <hi>Socrates,</hi> That one day whenhe was at <hi>Athens,</hi> ſeveral of his Schollars brought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to him, ſome rich preſents, ſome ſmaller; there was one poor Schollar that had nothing to give. <hi>but</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I will give him myſelf</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> eſteemed of that Gift, more than of all that had been offered to him. It's not only our duty, but our priviledge; ſometime a Beliver may go with that argument in his mouth, when he hath any compt to make to God, <hi>I am thine, ſave thou me,</hi> ſo when we make a perſonal covenant with Him, as we accept of the offer of Himſelf, of His Son, His Peace, His Pardon, the Land of Canaan, ſo we engage to reſign our ſelves to Him, and to give our ſelves to Him, which imports two things into it. 1. We give our ſelves to be diſpoſed of as to our work. <hi>2ly,</hi> We give our ſelves to be diſpoſed of as to our ſtation, in performing that work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We give our ſelves to be diſpoſed of as to our work, though it be a marriage Covenant, yet it partakes of a Covenant betwixt King and Subjects, Maſter and Servant, it's a Deſpotick Covenant, every Servant is not called to the ſame work; ſome of His commands, as ſome obſerve well, they both pleaſe HIm and us, they will pleaſe our fleſh, He bids us <hi>eat and drink, and cloath our ſelves,</hi> they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Covenant, and they pleaſe both Him and us; but there are many other commands, they pleaſe Him, as <hi>to take up the Croſs, to deny our ſelves,</hi> they pleaſe Him, but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43047:58"/>they are often unpleaſant to us; He may call one to preach, and another to ſuffer; In the perſonal Covenant with Him, we reſign and give over our ſelves, to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of as to our work, <hi>2ly,</hi> We give over our ſelves to be diſpoſed of, as to our ſtation, every veſſel in the houſe is not of gold, there are ſome of ſilver, and ſome of clay, and he that indentures in this perſonal Covenant, providing he be a veſſel for the maſter uſe, it's all one wheither he be gold, ſilver, or clay, the preſonal Covenant makes a gift of our ſelves to the Lord, with an abſolute reſignation of our lot, of our ſtation, and ſervice in the wilderneſs, if they be not a glazen window in the houſe, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, providing they be a nail in the wall; if they be not an eye, they are content, providing they be a toe, if it be for the good of the body. It's true, we are no great gift, when we have made a gift of our ſelves, yet it's that He calls for, and in perſonal Covenanting with Him, that we indenture for, like the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> we give our ſelves to the Lord, to be diſpoſed by the Lord; if He think proſperity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity for us, we are content; if He think a ſuffering lot, or a peaceable lot for us, we are content; or whether we be in a high place, or a low place, it's all one, for it's a clauſe in the indenture, we are to be at His diſpoſing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Covenant, we not only look to what we are to give, but what we are to do; it's true, all the Duties of the Covenant, ought to be done; in our Covenanting with Him, we are not to make exception of any of them, a Believer may perſonally Covenant with God, that does not diſtinctly take up all the Terms, on which the Covenant runs, yet they do not make exception of any of the Terms, but eſteems all his commands, concerning every thing to be right; ſome of them are greater, ſome of them are ſmaller; even in our indenturing in the Covenant of Grace, we are not to walk by the principles that others walk by; O ſay they, the Truths relating to exteranl Worſhip and Church Government, they are but ſmall things; the great duty is to accept of the Righteouſnes offered in the Covenant; they will perſonally Covenant with God, for theſe abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſpenſible and neceſſar things; but they think they need not take in theſe leſſer things into the Covenant; But like a man clipping gold, he will ſtoop down and left the leaſt clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43047:58"/>Why? it's gold; in our indenturing, we are not to make exception of any of the Terms, Why? the Terms are His, and there are two reaſons for this. 1. In the great Duty of the Covenant, the Father's deſign is, the exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His Son, it was one of the proofs I brought, to prove Him the Maker of the Covenant, it looked like the deſign of it, that He deſigned to cry up His Son; therefore the great violation of the Covenant lyes unbelief, and in not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Son which would be noticed by all, who will go mourning for other thins, and will be cheriſhing their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: There cannot be a greater affront put upon God, than what is put upon Him in His Son, in regard He is at the outmoſt of His offers, to ſpeak with reverence, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a greater offer, than of his Son, now an eye ought to be had to this great Duty eſpecially. But <hi>2ly,</hi> Theſe things wehrein our infirmity is greateſt, or that we are ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt woreſted by Temptation, in Covenanting to Terms, in our Coveranting which God, a ſpecial reſpect ought to be had to theſe, as <hi>Samſon</hi> had ſomething wherein his great ſtrength lay, in other things he was like another man; ſo every one of us hath ſomething wherein our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies; now in our Covenanting with God, if one be a neglecter of Family Duty, or if one be eaſily drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God, after evil company, if one be in a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and provocked to prophane and blaſpheme the holy and precious Name of God, if one be ſuperficial in ſecret Prayer; obſerve wherein the infirmity lies, and where the temptation does moſt eaſily worſt them, to have an eye in the perſponal Covenant with God, to theſe things; it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, when they write of the covenant, when the Spirit is about to challenge, for neglect of theſe things, there will nothing ſooner come in ones heart, than the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they made, like a knock of an hammer, it will drive in the Challenge, and roove the Nail to the head; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a ſpecial eye ought to be had for theſe infirmities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to us, wherein temptations uſes to aſſault us moſt. So I hope, laying theſe things together, I have proved, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perſonal covenanting with God lies, it lyes in accepting the Son, the Father hath offered Him, and all that he hath, and when the Soul accepts of this offer and relyes with an act of recumbency on the faithfulneſs of Him that made it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43047:59"/>and ſubſcribes to the Terms, both to give themſelves to the Lord back again, and to indenture to the Terms and Duties required, and particular indenturing agaiſt the infirmities we are eaſily beſet with, and that Temptation eaſily worſts them in; herein lies, as I conceive, tha Act of perſonal Covenanting with God, eſpecially if ye add to it in.</p>
            <p>The <hi>3d</hi> place, the manner how this acceptation, and this engagement is to be performed and gone about; and here I ſhall notice to you three or four things: (1.) Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in accepting this offer, and in Indenturing to theſe terms, in a perſonal Covenant with God, the action ought to be very deliberat and adviſed; it ought not to be, as one ſays, as a man loving a woman, at the firſt view he ſees her beautiful and comely, and preſently it goes in his heart he will marry her, not conſidering that ſhe may have much debt, and an evil humor, and many infirities following her; ſo, many in their perſonal Covenanting with Chriſt, they preſently fall in love with Glory, they fall in love with the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they ſee the Mediator beautiful and lovely, but they do not conſider the croſſes, the reproaches, the temptations the difficulties, that will accompany Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with him. It's remarkable in Scripture, it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the deed of the wife Merchant, that goes and ſells all that he may buy the Field where the Pearl is; this is not the act of a fool, it's not an haſty act, no, he goes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Field, and finds it's the Field where the Fearl is, and he goes and ſells all that he may but it; ſo, the ſould that Indentures with God on this ſcore, muſt conſider, it's a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs may coſt him all that he hath, he muſt conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pearl will compenſe the ſelling of all that he hath; There are many, it may, be truly ſaid of them, they are pound fools and peny wife, all the little wit they have in the Wilderneſs, is only like Children, it's how to build Houſes, and run after Flies, and busk Babies, but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation runs not about this. It's ſtrange to ſee many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in may things. and ſo far from reaſon in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the moſt thing wherein they play the fool is, there, but this Act of perſonal Covenanting, is a deliberat Act, it's an Act of the wife Merchant, who conſiders whether the Field and the Pearl will pay the coſt. <hi>(2ly,)</hi> This Act is to be an Act of the whole Soul, the underſtanding, will and

               </gap>ies they have engaged unto on Gods part, and they have written them down, and ſpread them before the Lord, and them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeribed them; which if they find of any uſe, when they have examined their way, they have run to the engagement they made to the Lord, and they find, if performing ſuch duties, yielding to ſuch temptations, be agreeable to the Covenant they made with God; therefore form the fear of the wrath of the Covenant, they have been made to mourn for Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant breaking with him. Now when things are thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43047:60"/>when with eonſent of the whole man, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent either to ſay, or to ſubſeribe, or to ſwear to God, that they take his offer, they hold him at his offer, they take hold of the offer, as it's offered, and will not alter the terms, but accepts of it on the very terms that it is made, this is the Act of perſonal covenanting with God, as I conceive.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the Application, there is one great difficulty neceſſary to be cleared, ye would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber both the grounds I brought in the forenoon to prove the neceſſity, and the Ecplication of that, wherein the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal act of perſonal covenanting conſiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> The queſtion neceſſary to be cleared is, whether is this perſonal Covenanting with God, the duty of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the viſible Church? Is there not a mixed mult tude of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and reprobat, and is not the Church like a Drag-net, wherein good and bad Fiſhes are, and can this perſonal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting and accepting the offer, and Indenturing to the terms, be the duty of the reprobate and bad Fiſhes in the Net? This is the toſſing of a great <hi>Arminian</hi> Queſtion, If I ſhould dilate in the Latitude, it would carry me before ſuch a popular Auditory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For Anſwer to the Queſtion, I will only ſay this, this Act of perſonal covenanting, is the duty of all within the viſible Church, and none is to go and exempt himſelf from it, but indeed eſpecially it is the duty of the Elect.</p>
            <p>There are Two Parts of this Anſwer, that I would labour to confirm to you, from ſome Reaſons, 1. That it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all within the viſible Church, thus Perſonally to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, ſhall appear from theſe things, 1. All to whom the offer of the covenant is made, are bound to the accepting of the offer; now whatever be in the purpoſe of God, the Promulgation and Proclamation of the covenant, and the offer of it, is made to all within the viſible Church, and who ſhall queſtion where there is an offer made, that it is preſumption to accept of it? Many ſtand at it, as if it were preſumption; I ſuppoſe one were coming by a houſe, and if the Maſter of the houſe ſhould look out at a window, and ſee him, and intreat him to come and dine with him, and eat and drink with him, would ye think it preſumption, eſpecially if he ſhould add Allurements, and Promiſes, and tell you that he hath killed his Fatlings, and mingled his wine, and if he ſhould not prevail with all theſe, if he ſhould look
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43047:60"/>our at the windom and cry, if ye will not come in, I ſwear I will come down and kill you; the Father hath done ſo in this Covenant, he hath given Intreaties, and Allurments, and Promiſes, and ſworn, if ye accept not of his offer, he will damn you eternally in hell. <hi>2ly.</hi> All whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Believing reaches, and who are concerned in it, are bound Perſonally to Covenant with God, but all in the viſible church are commanded to believe, and the great Root of the Sentence that will paſs againſt them will be, even the Reprobat, their not believing. <hi>3ly.</hi> If all were not bound thus Perſonally to Covenant with God, what can be the meaning of the many Regreates and Lamentations in the Goſpel, for many Reprobat ones, for their not Indenturing with him, to ſit down over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and weep, to upbraid <hi>Chorazin,</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> if they had not been bound thus Perſonally to Covenant with Him: So its the duty of all within the viſible church, all of them ly under an Obligation, to make a Covenant with him by Sacrifice, on no leſs hazard than what they are worth for ever and ever: But this is the duty of all, but eſpecially the Elect, the reaſons why it is the Elects duty, I will not dwell on them at this time, but will ſhew you, that though it be conſtantly the duty of the Elect, tobe making and keeping Covenant with God, yet there are ſome ſpecial times, wherein eſpecially they are called to it, and all I ſhall ſay in this Sermon, ſhall be to ſhew you Four or Five remarkable Junctures of Caſes, wehrein the Lord calls his Elect, to enter in, or to renew a Covenant, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irſt</hi> At their firſt effectual calling, when He hath made a law work, to make way for a Goſpel Work, when He hath ſent His Spirit to convince of Sin, and of Judgment, the Spirit hath a Couumiſſion alſo, to convince of Righteouſneſs, then eſpecially they are called to Perſonal Covenanting with God. And the truth is, the work of effectual Calling, the Term of it, that which perfytes it, and makes it effectual Calling, its not Challenges and Convictions of Sin, its the cloſing with Chriſt, and entering in a Perſonal Covenant with Him; for ſuppoſe we ſhould be able to tell, of never ſo many Challenges for Sin, and fears of Hell, they have had, they are not able to inſtruct from all theſe, their Effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if they have not come under a Perſonal Covenant with Chriſt; ſo any of you that are under the pangs of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Birth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43047:61"/>Birth, as there are ſome travelling among you, under fears, and griefs, and guiltineſs, and fears of Hell, the way of coming to a delivery, and an outgate from all theſe is, to enter in this Perſonal Covenant, to accept of the offer, and the Terms on which the offer is made. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's a very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time to enter in this Perſonal Covenanting with God, when there comes to be any ſpecial impreſſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, made on the Soul, we ought to take the ſtot of our hearts, readily it may be long before ye get that occaſion again, it's not your each days dinner, when ye get any Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Spirit, any delight, or any peace or joy in believing, any ſtriking of the Irons in Prayer, that the heart will affect the eye, when ye go to God, that is a ſpecial time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting with Him, in this caſe, we are to do as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Thou ſaidſt, ſeek ye my face,</hi> that is the Spirit working within him, it was even like a command, and my heart Anſwered, <hi>Thy face, Lord, I will ſeek, hide not thy face from me;</hi> So at your firſt Effectual Calling, it may be in ſome corner, ye may have ſome liberty to vent your heart to God, and ye may have ſome gale on your Spirit, ye cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that time better, as a cord to knit to the duny better, than to ſay, I accept of the Offer, and I accept of the Terms on which it's Offered, and I ſhall watch againſt the Failings wherein I have been weakeſt. <hi>3ly.</hi> It's a ſuitable time to enter in a Perſonal Covenant with God, after we have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in ſome great Sin againſt God, after we have been left to ſome Sin againſt God, that hath made a breach on the former Perſonal Covenant's, that we have made with Him: It may be ſome wide breach then, that come; to be a call to thee from God, to go and renew a Covenant with Him: It's remarkable in <hi>Thomas</hi>'s caſe, when Chriſt came in among the Diſciples, when <hi>Thomas</hi> was abſent; and they told him that Chriſt was riſen, and that they had ſeen him, O ſaith he, I will not believe, exccept I put my hand in his ſide, and in the print of the nails; Chriſt comes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces him of this Sin, and challenges him for it, and bids him not to be unbelieving, but faithful; and when he had ſeen him, and heard him, and had been convinced, thou art my Lord, and my God, ſayes he, it's as much as if he had ſaid, I will Indenture of new with Chriſt, and renew a Perſonal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, thou art my Lord, and my God; ſo that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43047:61"/>when there comes to be any breach betwixt God and us, that readily hath made a great ſlap in our former vows, when ye are not to go and run away, and give over hope, but even after <hi>Thomas</hi> would not believe, that Chriſt was riſen trom the dead, and was living, yet when he is throughly convinced of all, he ſaith, thou art my Lord, and my God. <hi>4ly.</hi> It's a fit time in entering in a Perſonal Covenant with God, when a Chriſtian comes under deſertion, and when there is a great Cloud betwixt him and God; It's remarkable, upon the caſe, Chriſt complains nore of Deſertion, than of the nails that was thurſt in Him; it was no wonder, if he Had taken ill with the Croſs, for He was daily with the Father, as one brought up with Him, and He was daily his delight, before the Mountains were brought forth; and a deſertion was heavy to Him, and what is His way he takes for outgate? He takes him to the Covenant, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> In this caſting a coppy to us, that there is no ſuch promiſing way under Deſertion, as the renewing of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Him <hi>Lastly.</hi> It's a fit time to enter in a perſonal Covenant with Him, at a Sealing Ordinance; the Sacrament of the Supper, it's a Seal of the New Teſtament in His Blood, and it may lay a great Obligation, on a looſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart, that if it get leave, will be thy death, as a poor man complained, <hi>Alas! my heart will be my death,</hi> thou that haſt ſuch a heart, thou art to enter in a perſonal Covenant with him, and take this Bread and this Wine, and ſay, I accept of this deemer, as the Father offers Him; I Indenture to the terms of the Goſpel, without exception of any of them; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the great things wherein I have been moſt negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; there is a fit time to enter this perſonal Covenant, when there is a Seal of the New Teſtament Paſſing as it were, out of his hand, into thine; and that is a great part of the Souls Communion with him, in that Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I will only exhort to two things, and with them cloſe this Sermon. 1. Chriſtian, wilt thou go and take a view of this Covenant, that thou may be encouraged, to engadge in it; many are ignorant of the Covenant, I complain of your ignorance of the Scriptures, and of your unacquaintedneſs with them, and for all the ſweetneſs of the Promiſes, that ye know nothing of them, that ye cannot ſay, as an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was wont to ſay, this is my Promiſe, a Believer ought to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43047:62"/>have ſeveral Promiſes in the Covenant, theſe which they have gotten, moſt reviving, quickning, and conſolation from; what an excellent thing is it, if one were going through the Bible, and through the Covenant, and doing as Apothecaries uſe to do, they go to a Garden, and they get a Flower here and there, and puts them up in Boxes, that when ſick folk comes, they may go rightly to the Box; ſO ought we to do with the Promiſes, we ought to gather the Promiſes in claſſes, ſo that when we have to do with any Promiſe, we may go to them, and take out a Promiſe ſuitable to our caſe. <hi>2ly.</hi> I exhort you to take a view of the Duties, and Terms of the Covenant; ye need not be diſcouraged at them, there is a kind of Heaven in holineſs, and the ſcope of them all is, to make us holy; it's true, the generality but breaks the ſhell, and gets not the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; there is nothing more ſweet and ſatisfying than the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, it's like Honey; all that taſte of it, cry more, more, but of all the werſheſt things in the world, is the ſhell.</p>

            <p>I Propoſed in the ſecond Branch of this <hi>verſe,</hi> three things to be conſidered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Who is the Author of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Of this I have ſpoken. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The parties conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered perſonally and particularly, and the ſpecial thing I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the laſt day, was, That every particular Believer ought perſonally and particularly to find himſelf concerned in the Covenant; and named five or ſix grounds, to prove the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs and neceſſity of perſonal covenanting with God: And then opened that Queſtion, wherein perſonal covenanting conſiſted: I alſo requited in this Queſtion, who were bound in this Duty of perſonal covenanting? I told you, that it was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43047:62"/>the duty of all the Members of the viſible Church, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Elect. I ſhall now, that I may the more fully open the Duty of our perſonal and particular covenanting, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a covenant of Grace with God; open ſome properties of this Act, of perſonal indenturing and covenanting with God, and I ſhall name theſe five or ſix of them, and from them ye will better underſtand the nature of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Act of perſonal covenanting with God, it's an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary Act, it's indiſpenſibly neceſſary, that we ſhould accept his offer in the covenant, and bind our ſelves to the Terms of the covenant; and that is the firſt character and property of it. It's obſerved by Divines, there are ſome things God hath forbidden, there are ſome things God hath left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and hath neither commanded nor fordidden them; there are ſome things God has commanded, and they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> they are to be obeyed <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as the Sacrament of the New Teſtament is; and there are ſome things neceſſar <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> as School-men ſpeaks, we cannot be ſaved without them. Now this Act of perſonal covenanting with God, is of this nature, it's of abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will appear from the conſideration of theſe three or four things. 1. Unleſs we particularly and perſonally, and expreſly accept of the covenant of Grace, and indenture with God on the Terms of the covenant, we cannot be ſtated in a Covenant-relation with God. The Covenant made in Baptiſm by our Parents, wherein we have but a virtual conſent, doth not ſtate us in a real covenant with God, until we really Indenture, and with conſent covenant with Him in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; ſo until we conſent, we muſt be under the curſe and covenant of Works, in all the Clauſes and Heads of it, and cannot claim unto the Covenant of Grace, in all the Clauſes and Articles of it; for there cannot be a Covenant-relation with God, until we expreſly, particularly, and perſonally Indenture in a perſonal Covenant with Him. <hi>2ly.</hi> Until we thus particularly and perſonally Covenant, we cannot have any benefit by Chriſt's Death; whatever he hath purchaſed, (and he hath purchaſed great things) yet, until we accept and take hold of the Covenant, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and perſonally Indenture in it, we can have no benefit by his Death: the Covenant is as it were the Contract, and there is no woman that has a right to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43047:63"/>but ſhe that marries the man; until we be unite to Chriſt, we can have no benefit by the Covenant; and until we enter in the Covenant, we cannot be unite to him. Epheſ. 2.12. <hi>At that time ye were aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe;</hi> mark how theſe two go together, <hi>without chriſt, and ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe;</hi> even ſo that until we come to Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perſonally and particularly in the Covenant, we are without Chriſt, and without a right to the benefits of his Death. <hi>3ly.</hi> Until we come perſonally, and particularly to indenture with God, and accept of the Covenant of Grace, we can have no comfortable views of Providence, eſpecially if they be dark and humbling Providences. The Covenant is as it were a Key, that opens all Providences: it's a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable word, Pſal. 25.10. <hi>All his ways are mercy and truth, to ſuch as keep his covenant:</hi> mark here, <hi>all his ways are mercy and truth.</hi> And how come they to be known to be Mercy and Truth? They come to be known <hi>by our intereſt in the Covenant,</hi> and by the Covenant it ſelf. Let him do to us what he will; let Him correct, and let Him do it never ſo ſharply, yet by the Covenant, and our Interſt in it, we ſee them to be Mercy and Truth. <hi>4ly.</hi> Until we thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally Indenture and Covenant with God, we neither owne our Baptiſm, nor can we rightly Communicat; there is a Covenant indeed made with God by our Parents in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in whom we virtually conſent to the Covenant, in all the Clauſes and Articles of it, but this not enough; as a man ſuiting a woman, he judges it not enough that he have her Parents conſent, it's her ſelf he muſt marry, and he muſt have her own expreſs conſent before they marry; ſo in Baptiſm, our Parents gave their conſent that we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſt on the Terms of the Covenant; but we never owne our Baptiſm, until we perſonally covenant with God; neither go we rightly about the Sacrament of the Supper, which is as Seal of the Covenant, until we perſonally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture and Covenant with Him. <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Until we perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant and Indenture with God, there can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable viewing of the Great Day, the thoughts of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eternity are terrible to them, that have not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant: It's a remarkable word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. The beginning whereof, the current of Interpreters refer it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43047:63"/>to the Judgement of the Great day, in the 5. and 6. <hi>verſes. Gather my Saints to me, thoſe that have made a covenant with me by ſacrifice, the heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſs, for God is judge himſelf:</hi> mark here, that Day will be a comfortable day to the Saints, and who are they that are to be gathered to him that day? It's thoſe that have made a Covenant by Sacrifice with Him, and God himſelf is Judge: now lay all theſe five together, and ye will find that this particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denturing with Him, is of abſolute neceſſity.</p>
            <p>But I come to a ſecond property of this Covenant, this Act of covenanting perſonally with God, and accepting of the Covenant of Grace, perſonally and particularly, as it is an Act of abſolute neceſſity, it ought to be a Deliberat well pondered Act, no Act ought more to be pondered: many go about this raſhly, they are like that <hi>Scribe</hi> that came to Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20. The <hi>Scribe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt.</hi> Chriſt tells him, <hi>the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head;</hi> but we read no more of that <hi>Scribe,</hi> it's as much as thou art not deliberat, thou offers to follow me whitherſoever I go, it's a raſh offer, thou knows not what thou ſayeſt. This Act ought to be a very deliberat Act on theſe grounds. 1. Man is a rational Agent; Reaſon is the great ſpecifick Difference, diſtinguiſhing him from a Bruit; if in any thing his Reaſon is to be exerciſed, it's in his Religion: for however, God hath called us to believe ſeveral things, which our Reaſon cannot comprehend, as that there ſhould be three Perſons in one Eſſence, two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one Perſon, our Reaſon cannot fathom, nor dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep of theſe Myſteries; yet there is nothing in our Religion contrare to Reaſon, and however we have ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Spectacles, that we will take the thing for Reaſon the day, which we will count Folly to morrow; however our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſince the Fall, hath gotten a Wound, that makes us like <hi>Jacob,</hi> go halting, when he is touched on the hollow of his Thigh; and yet ſo much of the exerciſe of Reaſon is left to us, as that in our Religion there is a ſpecial exerciſe for it; God calls not man in this Act of perſonal covenanting, to deny his Reaſon, but rather to exerciſe it. And when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian goes in his walk with God on well founded Reaſons, Scriptural Reaſons, and the Authority of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43047:64"/>readily that Chriſtian is not frothie, driven like chaff before every wind of Temptation, but is ſolid in his walk. <hi>2ly.</hi> This Act of perſonal covenanting with God, ought to be deliberat, in regard of the great importance of it: Nature will teach us, that things of great importance, ought to be done with great deliberation; and hardly is there a thing of more importance, than our accepting of the Covenant of Grace, and Indenturing with the Father, on the Terms of the Covenant: many ponder not the importance of it, but it's of ſo great importance, as for all Eternity, ſo long as God will be God, it's of importance for us, it ought to be very deliberat, unleſs we will be pound fools, and penny wiſe, who will be deliberat in Trifles, like children busk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Babies, and rickling up their Houſes. <hi>2ly.</hi> It ought to be deliberat, in regard undeliberat Actions to God-ward, makes them ſoon evaniſh; there are ſome, if they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afflictions, or if they fall in ſickneſs, or a Fever, and God ſhake Death over their head; or if they be at ſome ſolemn Ordinance, they will be at reſolving and purpoſing, and readily bringing vows on hemſelves, of perſonal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God, but as they are eaſily gotten, ſo they eaſily evaniſh. Pſal. 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought after him, and returned and enquired early after God;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times our affections are like a Gutter, when there is a great Showre, we will be running over with purpoſes after God; <hi>Nevertheleſs they flattered him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongue, for their heart was not right with God, nor were they ſtedfast in his covenant:</hi> and yet when he ſlew them, they ſought after him, and they yearly enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after him: ſo that indeliberat Actions and covenatings with God, as they are haſtily begotten, they no leſs ſuddenly evaniſh; the SAction ought then to be deliberat when we In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with the Cautioner, and obliges our ſelf to more watchfulneſs, and more tenderneſs, or elſe it will ſoon evaniſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here I will clear a Queſtion, whereabout are we to deliberat, what is a perſon to deliberat about, when he thus Indentures with God? The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is obvious, and I will reduce what I will ſay of it to two heads. 1. We are to deliberat, to conſider and ponder what Offers God makes in the Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> On what Terms theſe Offers are made, both theſe two being by a rational ſoul
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43047:64"/>rationally pondered, may have great influence on a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work with God, and not prove a flaſh, like what is in an Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are to conſider, and deliberat on the Tenor of the Offer made by God, which we are to conſider poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and comparatively. 1. Poſitively, we are to conſider his Offers; the multitude of them, the greatneſs of the things he offers: ſome have laboured to reduce them to heads, he not only makes offer of peace and pardon, and happineſs in the Covenant, but to ſpeak with reverence of the Majeſty of God, he is at the utmoſt of what he can offer: to ſay it with reverence, it's impoſſible for Him to make greater Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, He cannot make greater Offers than of Himſelf, and of his Son, and both theſe He offers in the Covenant for all Eternity. Now when we enter in a perſonal Covenant with God, we are to ponder the Promiſes of the Covenant, that they are great and precious Promiſes: we are to conſider the multitude of things offered in it, and the greatneſs of them, that in a manner, He is at his utmoſt in His offers, He cannot make a greater Offer. <hi>2ly.</hi> We are to conſider theſe Offers comparatively; the heart of man hath many Wooers ſuiting it; ſometimes it hath ſomething in the World ſuiting it, ſometimes Luſts are ſuiting it, ſometimes Sathan is ſuiting it, ſometimes one thing, ſometimes another; but let them carry it that makes the beſt Offers: lay theſe Offers in the Ballance with what the World offers, and the Honours and Advantages of it, lay them in the Ballance with what your Luſts offer, and with what Sathan offers, and let them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Heart who makes the greateſt Offer: the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe things, when one ſits down like that man, that when he came to the exerciſe of his Reaſon, he began to conſider, it's not long ſince I came to the World, and in a little I will be no more in it, and wherefore came I to it, what is my buſineſs in it? There are many things ſuiting my heart, and whoſo makes the beſt and the greateſt, and the ſureſt Offers, let them carry it. Such a Soliloque betwixt a man &amp; his his Soul, acting like a ratinal Agent, will readily put the ſoul to accept of the offer of the Covenant, and Indenture with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are likewiſe to conſider the Terms on which theſe Offers are made, and upon which we are to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with God: many will make this Bargain, as ſometime a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43047:65"/>Drunkard will make a freſh bargain in his drink, that when he is freſh, he rues it, and would ſteal from it again: but we are to conſider the Terms, on which we enter in this Covenant, and we can never rightly enter in this Covenant with God, (and without entering in this Covenant, we cannot be ſaved) except we ponder the Terms on which we Indenture, and there are three things neceſſar to be pondered about them. 1. The multitude of them, it's true the Covenant is a covenant of Grace, adn not a Covenant of Works; and as I ſaid, believing in Jeſus, and accepting of Him, is the only proper condition of the condition of the Covenant of Grace; God in the Covenant of Grace, hath bound us to all the Duties be hath commanded in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, what a multitude of them there are, take a compend of them in that word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. at the beginning, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God;</hi> mark there, we muſt cleanſe our ſelves of the fil hineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit; a famous Ancient ſaid well, when he read that <hi>verſe,</hi> this ſeems to me ſays he, like the Meſſage the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 Kings 5.2. <hi>I have ſent my ſervant to thee, that thou mayeſt recover him of his leproſie;</hi> what ſays he, <hi>am I a God, to kill and make alive, that this man ſendeth to me to cure him of his leproſie? 2ly.</hi> We are to conſider, the conſtancy we are bound to in theſe Terms, if we enter in Covenant with God, it's a marriage Covenant, whatever fall out to a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, except Adulters, the marriage-tye remains firm; if one were never ſo ſickly or tender, it does not break that tye, all the variety of caſes his people can come under, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſſolve it; we are not to be Time-ſervers in theſe things, for in a little, they that ſerve Time, their Maſter will be taken from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5. <hi>And I ſaw an angel Hand upon the ſea, and he lift up his hand to heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there ſhould be time no longer.</hi> But <hi>3ly.</hi> We are to conſider the difficulties that will accon pany theſe Terms; the Terms are, <hi>to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in the fear of God;</hi> what multitude of difficulties muſt theſe Terms be carried on with? will they make a man walk like an Owl among the reſt of the Birds? What a deal
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43047:65"/>of croſſes and difficulties will attend him that makes a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God? Now one that would Indenture in a perſonal Covenant with God, muſt conſider and ponder all theſe. Now this is the ſecond Property of perſonal Indenturing with God, it's an Act of abſolute neceſſity, and we ought to be very deliberat and ſerious in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Act of perſonal covenanting as it ought to be deliberat, ſo it ought to be ſincere, and an Act of the whole Soul. Pſal. 16.2. <hi>O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my God:</hi> God will diſpenſe with any Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in this Act, ſooner than Hypocriſie, He cannot endure to be mocked: For clearing this, that it ought to be done with the whole Soul, I would have you notice, <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Act of perſonal covenanting, requires a very well ordered Soul, not only Morally well ordered, but Spiritually; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines obſerve well, the Soul is well ordered in two Caſes;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When the Will comes to beled by the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeveral times the Will like a domineering Lady, it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it's Liberty and Freedom, it will bind the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and draw it after it; we are eaſily brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, what the Will inclines us to, and to find our Reaſons, for juſtifying of the thing which it deſires. <hi>Next,</hi> the Soul is well ordered, when Underſtanding, Will and Affections follow the Conſcience, and the Conſcience is regulat by the Word of God; the Affections, often it holds true of them that is ſaid of Fire and Water, they are good Servants, but ill Maſters; when the affections comes to domineer, they are ill Maſters, but when they are ruled by the Conſcience, and the Conſcience regulat by the Law of God, ſo that we can moderat our Anger and not ſin, that we can deſire nothing but what we lawfully deſire, and we fear nothing, but what we lawfully can fear; when gref keeps within it's bounds, when the Affections are thus regulat, what a ſweet calm is there in the Conſcience, like an Inſtrument, that all the Strings of it are rightly placed, and when ye ſtrike on them, every ſtring gives the ſound they ought to give; ſo the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will and Affections, when they are rightly regulat, they give the ſound that is proper for them; when the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is thus regulat, that the Will follows the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the Soul is regulat by the Conſcience, and the Conſcience by the Word of God. <hi>2ly.</hi> This Soul covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43047:66"/>it imports a rightly ordered frame of the Soul, for it's an affectionat and ſincere Act, it's not to be wrung out of us; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calumniats Proteſtants, when he ſays, we maintain in the Act of Effectual Calling, that <hi>Deus torquet voluntatem,</hi> in he doth not thraw the Will, no, in this Act of perſonal covenanting, it uſes to be done, when it's done with the Soul, not with the Affections only, but with the Benſil of the Affections; it's as it were the marriage day, and in that day, the Soul is clothed in its beſt Appatel, and the Unferſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will and Affections, are at the height of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Fervency, it's neceſſar it ſhould be ſo; for the Lord when he entered in Covenant with us, O! ſo ſincerely and affectionaly as He enters, and when he hath found the loſt Goat and ſtragling Sheep, He call His neighbours and friends to rejoyce with Him. Luk. 15. <hi>I likewiſe ſay, there is joy in Heaven over one ſinner that repents,</hi> &amp;c. When he doth it ſo affectionatly, and is ſo much taken when a perſon doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally Covenant with Him, ought we not to Covenant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely with the Benſil of the Affections.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourth</hi> Property of it, it's an Act that ought to be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſpeedily, and early done without delay; ſome of our Divines in their caſuiſtical Diſputs with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they rationally alledge, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Popiſh Caſuiſts</hi> in ſome Principles, tends to hough all the Practiſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for among other things, they maintain, that if a ſinner fall in ſin, he is obliged to repent, when he comes under ſome croſs, or at ſome ſolemn Ordinance, or at the hour of Death; we maintain againſt them, that a ſinner is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to repent, immediatly on the back of the commiſſion of the Sin, the ſame we ſay of perſonal covenanting with God, it's to be done without delay, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</hi> Heb. 3.7. Cited out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7. It's not ſaid to morrow if ye will hear his voice, but <hi>to day;</hi> It's true, there are ſome times and caſes, when it's ſweeter going about this work, than at other times; there are ſome approaches in Spirit to us, which we ſhould exactly obſerve, as Courtiers that have their <hi>Nobiliſſima fandi tempora,</hi> they get ſome fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of putting up their Petitions to Princes. 1. It's an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent time in going about this work, of Indenturing, vowing, and reſolving with Chriſt, when the Spirit is making his approaches; yet we are not to delay till theſe times, for the Command of God lies on us at all times: It's a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of <hi>Quakers,</hi> that think they will not pray, or hear, but when the Splrit comes; the Obligation to Duty is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Command lies on us, whether we be in frame, or out of frame. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's true, the Lord will ſometimes deny his People aſſiſting Grace, that he may make way for accepting Grace: He will leave them to toyl, and wreſtle with Duties, and then He will take the ſtrained Duty off their hand; ſeveral times He will do with them, as He did with the poor Widow, to whom He gave but two Mites to caſt in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and He accepts of them; He will leave one to toyl, and wreſtle with Duty, as one under Irons, and then kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept of the Duty; ſo, whether we be in frame or not, as we ſhould pray, read and meditat, ſo it's not in theſe times only, that we ſhould make a perſonal Covenant with God, but we are to do it without delay, and that upon theſe Reaſons. 1. Hardly is there a greater mercy beſtowed on a perſon, than when they give their youth to God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43047:67"/>early to ſeek Him; it's remarkable, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhuts up that Book of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> with <hi>Rmember thy Creator in the days of thy youth;</hi> the time that others give to vanity, the time that is moſt difficult to be regulat by Reaſon and Religion, we are to give that time to God, and to begin to enter in a perſonal Covenant with Him, <hi>2ly</hi> It ought to be done without delay, in regard of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of time, and of the Goſpel Offers; we are all of us Tennents at will, we know not what to morrow will bring forth, it's a wonder to ſee, what a number of doors can eaſily be opened to let us in to the Grace, and many have died very ſpeedily; that young Divine that died in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when he was yet a young man, he wrote a Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſays, ſome have died of an hair in Milk, ſome have fallen back from off the Stool that they ſat on and died; now, ſince both the time, and the Offers of the Goſpel are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, this accepting of the Offer, and Indenturing on the Terms of the Covenant, ought to be done with all ſpeed, and without delay. <hi>3ly.</hi> It ought to be done timeouſly, and ſpeedily, in regard, ay the longer one continues in ſin, and in a natural eſtate, they are conſtantly the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Conſcience like a foot that it uſed to go bare, it gathers a ſcurff; what a rare thing is Converſion in old age, how ſeldom falls it out? So that this Work of perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, ought to be done without delay; for ay the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it's delayed, the heart grows the more averſe, and the more hardned, and the cuſtom of ſinning takes away the conſcience of it. <hi>4ly.</hi> It ought to be done ſpeedily, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, many times delays puts the Work wholly by, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done when it is delayed; there are ſeverals, as a man reported of himſelf when he was dying, that took this gate of it, If I were once come to thirty years, I would be holy, and when he comes to thirty, he puts it off till he came to fourth, and when he came to fourty he died, Lamenting that he had delayed and put off ſo long. It was ſo with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach of Righteouſneſs and Jedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, I will bear thee, ſays he, at a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, and that convenient time never came: yet, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily delays evaniſhed in nothing. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> it ought to be done without delay, in regard as we tell <hi>Papiſts</hi> in caſuiſtical Diſputs, that Death-bed Repentauce is very ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43047:67"/>it's true, we read of one, and but one in all the Bible, the good Thief on the Croſs, who got Repentance at Death, there is one to ſhew its poſſible, and but one, to ſhew that it's not very probable. The Scripture calls it an <hi>houling on the bed,</hi> readily the Lord will ſay to them then, <hi>Becauſe I called, and ye did not hear, ye ſhall call, and I will not hear; I have ſtretched out my hand all the day long to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people;</hi> it's remarkable in the Vine-yard, ſome are called at the ſeventh hour, ſome at the eight, ſome at the ninth, ſome at the eleventh; but why are there not ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the tweltth? They ſay, that the twelfth hour is the time of diſmiſſing Servants, and not of putting them to their work. All theſe preſſes, that this Act of accepting the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Indenturing through the Mediator, ought to be done early, and without delay. This is the fourth Property.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As it ſhould be done deliberatly, ſincerely, and timeouſly; ſo it ſhould be done confidently, and boldly, Heb. 4 16 <hi>Let us come with boldneſs unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</hi> Let us come bodly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, let us confidenly ſpeak out all that is in our heart.</p>
            <p>But ye will ask, why may we not do it tremblingly, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and doubtingly? I will tell you ſome Grounds, on which Faith may build confidence in this Act of Indentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with God. 1. We have the Command of God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with Him, and accept of this Covenant; it's the great Command He has given, if we ſlight Him in this Command, He values not what we do in other things. John 3.23. <hi>This is his command, that ye believe on his Son:</hi> that is a ground of confidence, not only hath He commanded it, but He hath threatned, if we ſlight Him in this; remember the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I illuſtrat to you the other day, ſuppoſe ye were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by a houſe, and the Maſter of the houſe ſhould cry down to you, come in and eat and drink with me, were it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption for your to come in, eſpecially if he ſhould ſwear, if ye come not in, I will come out and kill you? So the Lord in His Indenturing in the Covenant, hath not only commanded, but he hath ſworn by himſelf. he will caſt you in hell, if ye do not accept of Him. <hi>2ly.</hi> Deſperat neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a ground of confidence; I confeſs in all the Books that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43047:68"/>I have read, o're all the Sermons that I have heard, I know not a poſſible way how to eſcape hell, but by taking hold of this Covenant, deſperat neceſſity helps to boldneſs; ye remember the <hi>Lepers</hi> at the Gates of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who were to hazard on the Camp of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> all the men of War durſt hardly hazard on them, but their motive was good, if we ſtay here we ſhall die, and they hazarded on the Camp of the <hi>Syrians:</hi> if thou be without this Covenant, thou art eternally ruined. Now to go and accept of the Covenant, take hold of it, and perſonally to Indenture with God in it, may be a great help and motive to confidence; thou may reaſon with thy ſelf, I am eternally ruined without it, there is no other way to eſcape the fire that burns in the bottom of Hell, but by taking hold of it. <hi>3ly.</hi> This may be a ground of confidence in going about it, in that there is nothing promiſed in it, but Chriſt hath purchaſed it; it's true, all this is of free Grace, in regard the giving of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer was an act of free Grace; <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is juſt to forgive;</hi> any would think, it would ſuit better to ſay, He is merciful and gracious to forgive, but He is juſt to forgive; to ſpeak it with reverence, it were in conſiſtent with Juſtice, not to pardon Sin, and ranſome the Elect, for whom He hath received a Price; the Price is payed, and we may ſay, how ſweet ſoever the pardon of Sin be, and peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and communion with God, yet there is ſomething given for it, beyond the value of them, for they are all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the Blood of God. <hi>4ly.</hi> We ſhould do it confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, in regard, when we go to Indenture with God, the want of confidence fills us with doubting, which is very near of kin to unbelief: often, if we be to Indenture with God, the ſmell of Corruptions, and Temptations, and a diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Spirit ſtriking in with it, makes it like the Meteors that aſcend upward, they may go to and fro, but at length they reſolve in Clouds, and fall down upon the earth again: So, when we go to perſonal covenanting with God, doubtings and fears, the ſmell of guiltineſs, and a multitude of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, produces a wavering in the Spirit, which is the next door to unbelief; now to be free of this, we ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with confidence and boldneſs: There are many that Indenture with him in a perſonal Covenant, and the next
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43047:68"/>day a very ſmall Temptation makes them doubt that it was a perſonal Covenant. Why? They had ſo much fear, and ſo many doubtings in the menagement of it; thererefore, we are to loup over all our difficulties, and cut them all with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and this is the right way of managing a perſonal Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Property of it, as this Act ſhould be confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo it ſhould be done with full purpoſe of heart, as <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas Acts.</hi> 11.23. exhorts them all at <hi>Antioch, to cleave unto the Lord with full purpoſe of heart;</hi> this Act oſ perſonal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting on our part, the firſt beginning of it lyes meerly in Purpoſes and Reſolutions, on which we caſt on the knot of a Vow in perſonal covenanting with God; therefore I will ſpeak a little to theſe Purpoſes and Reſolutions, that in the firſt act of the ſouls perſonal covenanting with God, are that in a manner, wherein the Act of covenanting with Him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and two things I will ſpeak to it. (1.) I ſhall ſhew what weight is to be laid on theſe Purpoſes and Reſolutions of the heart, when it's about to covenant with God, <hi>(2ly.)</hi> I ſhall ſhew you what are the reaſons, why many of theſe Purpoſes and Reſolutions prove ſo evaniſhing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What weight is to be laid on theſe purpoſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of heart? I deſire ye may take notice, that when we come with full purpoſe of heart, to enter in a perſonal Covenant with God, there is a conſiderable weight to be laid on theſe purpoſes, if ye notice theſe things. (1.) The rational way of the Spirits working is, firſt to convince the Underſtanding, and then to determine the Will to purpoſe and chooſe. I confeſs, Philoſophers call the purpoſes of the Will <hi>Velleities,</hi> they deny it to be that elicit Act of the Will which they call <hi>Velle,</hi> but yet they ſuppoſe a complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Object; and ye will find theſe three or four things about them in Scritpre, <hi>Firſt,</hi> When there is no more but a purpoſe, the Lord will commend it, even when one is but purpoſing and reſolving. It's a remarkable word, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. The Lord ſends the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to tell him, <hi>Becauſe it was in thy heart to build me a houſe, I will build thee a ſure houſe;</hi> he ſays not, <hi>becauſe thou haſt builded me a houſe, David</hi> had no more but a purpoſe of building a houſe, he could not endure to dwell in houſes of Cedar, and the Ark of God in Curtains; any would have thought,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43047:69"/>that the Lord would have ſtayed until <hi>David</hi> had builded him an houſe, but he had no more but a purpoſe, becauſe it was in thine heart to build me an houſe, I will build thee a ſure houſe. And it's remarkable, that the Prodigal <hi>Luke</hi> 15. When he was in a far Countrey, he came only to reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, he is only ſaying, <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my father, and ſay I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and when he was yet far off, his father ſaw him, and ran and kiſsed him, and embraced him. (2ly.)</hi> Theſe purpoſes, ſeveral times they contribute to determine the Will; the Will is an unſtayed thing in us, it's like running water, ye will not find it one hour where it was another, it goes like a Wheels, the Spaik that is up now, is preſently donw, and we are willing the things to day, that we are loathing the morn; it's rouch to get the Will determined, and if any thing do it, it will be a purpoſe with the cord of a Vow, and the cord of God faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. <hi>(3ly.)</hi> Theſe purpoſes have ſomething good in them, they are like the flouriſh of an Apple-Tree, though it may be it be nto compleatly an Apple, yea many of them falls off, and is never an Apple, yet they have ſomething of the Apple in them, there is ſomething of God in theſe purpoſes: it's true, it's a great agrravation of ones guiltineſs, is God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, and brought them to purpoſes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if they fall away from them, it's hard to renew them again by repentance; the Lord by his Spirit, is doing with them, as a man taking a Key to open a Lock, if he throw about the Key and open not the Door, he readily ſpills the Lock: where there are purpoſes and reſolutions, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from them, it's one to ten thouſand, but the Lock is ſpilt, and readily will never be opened by that Key: yet there is good in theſe purpoſes, they are like a ſmoaking flax, that hath ſomething of fire in at, but it can do no more but ſmoak; and he that will not quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed reed, will not readily ſet his foot on theſe purpoſes: ſo when we come to Indenture with God, and with full purpoſe of heart Covenant, that we will keep by the terms of the Covenant, and accept of the offers of it, it's a character of perſonal covenanting with God.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> And here I will clear this caſe what is the reaſon that there are ſo many purpoſes and reſolutions to God that evaniſh, we makes a Covenant with him to day, and Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43047:69"/>againſt theſe ſins that our remptations carries us moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away, as there are ſome things wherein every one is weakeſt, what is the reaſon that theſe purpoſes do ſo often evaniſh?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will name two or three things that influences this, (1.) Serveral times we purpoſe in our owe ſtrength, we put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and we go in our own ſtrength: It's a remarkable thing in <hi>Either,</hi> ſhe ſaw the dauger that the Church of God and her people were in, and ſhe ſends to <hi>Mrdecai,</hi> and tells him, <hi>I will go to the King, if I periſh, I periſh,</hi> though it be againſt the Law; but ſays ſhe, <hi>Conveen thy people, and faſt three days, and I and my maids will do likewiſe;</hi> there is a thing difficult to be done, ſhe goes not in her own ſtrength, but ſhe carries it on by prayer: when we go out againſt any corruption within us, we are like <hi>David</hi> going out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Goliah</hi> with a ſling and with a ſtone, and what would that ſignfie? unleſs he had that to tell, <hi>I come to thee in the Name of the Lord, whom thou haſt blaſphemed;</hi> the ſling and the ſtone, and the Name of the Lord, was ſtrong enough againſt a <hi>Goliah;</hi> but when we go againſt any corruption in our own ſtrength, we go like <hi>David,</hi> with a ſling, and with a ſtone, and not in the Name of the Lord. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our purpoſes evaniſh when we are ſick, or at a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or when we are at a low ebb, we do not as <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,</hi> carry them on by Prayer; nor as <hi>David,</hi> in the Name of the God of Iſreal. <hi>(2ly,)</hi> Several times there comes purpoſes and reſolutions in the ſoul, or convictions of the Spirit, and theſe purpoſes evaniſh, becauſe they have not been ſincere, deliberat and ſerious enough, readily they have been extorted by fears, and readily we do as <hi>Earſmus</hi> reports of the man, that when he was at Sea, vowed he would offer a pound of Candle to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> when he came to Shore, but when he came to Shore, he ſaid a Plack Candle might ſerve here: Readily we do as that man, when we are under a ſtrait, we come under vows, and when the ſtrait is over, like one come to Land, we forget all; this is the reaſon why many their purpoſes evaniſh, the Lord will lift off the Croſs, and the Spirit abates their challenges, and the humility that will ſometimes be in them, will be but like the Dogs returning to his vomit again. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that after the Flood, the inhabitants of the World that were the poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> for fear of a new Deluge, built their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43047:70"/>Houſes on the tops of Hills, but when they ſee there is no new Deluge like to come, ye find them in the Plains of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> building a <hi>Babel,</hi> whoſe top reaches to Heaven; this is a great cauſe why our purpoſes evaniſh, under a ſtrait we would take the Covenant and the righteouſneſs of it, but when our fears and challenges are away, like a man in a rainy day, that will take an old Cloak about him, but when the ſhowre is paſt, he lays by the old Cloak. But <hi>(3ly.)</hi> Theſe purpoſes and reſolutions evaniſh, by the company of the ungodly, there is nothing will ſooner coo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, than the company of the wicked; It's a remarkable reſolution of <hi>Davids, Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, Why? I have reſolved to keep his Commands,</hi> and I know I will not follow this reſolution, if ye do not depart from me: oftentimes there is nothing makes purpoſes ſooner evaniſh, than the company of wicked men, therefore the young man whom <hi>Solomon</hi> would have kept from the whoriſh woman, among many directions he gives this, <hi>My ſon, go not near her door,</hi> not only commit no uncleanneſs with her, but go not near her door.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The laſt property of this act of perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, as it hath all theſe ſix that I have mentioned, ſo it hath this character, as it is often broken ſo it ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten renewed; we are frequently breaking our Covenant; how many times will we bind againſt a luſt, or to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of duty, and readily, if a man ſhould bind himſelf as for inſtance, to ſecret Prayer, to reading the Scripture the Lord will tryſt him with ſome tryal, with ſome diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with ſomething that will appear vertue to him, or that will appear to be his intereſt, to try if this will make him break, and if on this account we break, we ſhould be as oft renewing again; and two things will evidence, that when we come to break our engagements of perſonal Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we are no to ſay, <hi>there is no help for my ſoul in God.</hi> (1.) Take notice, that one God part with them, the Covenant remains conſtantly firm: Think ye the Covenant everlaſting, bacauſe we everlaſtingly keep it? It's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, becauſe he is everlaſting, and everlaſtingly keeps laſting, becauſe he is everlaſting, and everlaſtingly keeps it. So he calls often to us to renew this Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers;</hi> any would have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43047:70"/>thought, the next word would be, thou ſhall never be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me again; yet the next word is, yet <hi>return unto me, backsliding children, for I am married to you, and I will take you one of a tribe, and two of a family, and bring you to Zion. (2ly.)</hi> This evidences that the Covenant ſhould be renewed becauſe the Sacrament of the Supper is renewed, he hath commanded the Sacrament of the Supper to be often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and what is that, but to renew a perſonal Covenant with him? <hi>(3ly,)</hi> The renewing of the Covenant is our only ſafety, there is no other way of doing for us in ſafety, and eſchewing the wrath of God, but by renewing the Covenat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I will only cloſe this day with a word or two, of practical improvement of all that hath been ſaid of theſe ſeven characters of perſonal Covenanting with God. (1.) I exhort you who are minding this, as the great deſign ye have, to put you to accept the offer of this Goſpel, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with God, ont he terms that are made; labour from all that is ſaid, to take up the nature and properties of this perſonal Covenanting with God, many never knew what it meant, and therefore they never practiſed it. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for giving you light in this matter, what ye heard the laſt day, of the nature of the Covenant, and of the acts it conſiſted of, and theſe properties that ye have hard of it, that it is an act of abſolute neceſſity, there is no ſafety through all eternity, but in the doing of it; conſider that it's an act that is deliberat, that is ſincere, that is done with confidence, and ſhould have a full purpoſe of heart, in the beginning of Indenturing, with God, and when it's broken, ſhould be renewed; take it up thus, and it may give you a great deal of light. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> I would have you for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, be taking good notice what God doth in his part of the Covenant to you; readily when ye are about to Covenant with him, if he give warmneſs of heart, if he give a full purpoſe of heart, if he give any act of confidence, if he give deliberaltly to caſt over the cord of a vow, for our after-walking, or if he give full purpoſes and reſolutions of heart, ye may take theſe things from him as an earneſt that he will do more; if ye find theſe things, ye may do as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> to <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſhe goes to <hi>Boaz</hi>'s Field, and he bids the Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers let ſome Heads fall to her; the next day ſhe comes, and he lays on a burden of Corn on her back; <hi>Naomi</hi> finds him
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43047:71"/>taking this courſe with her, ſit down my Daughter, ſays <hi>Naomi,</hi> for the man will not be at reſt, until thou be Lady of the whole Field: If he be beginning the accompliſhment of the promiſes, let it be but a Head falling this day, and a Head another day, this is a ſure Earneſt that ye will come to enjoy all that the Covenant contains, and will be Ruler over all that he hath. <hi>(3ly)</hi> I would have thee that art thus Indenturing, and reſolving from all theſe Sermons, to give thy ſelf to him, and to give him thy ſervice in thy while of this Wilderneſs, do not only purpoſe, but endeavour to perform: It's lamentable to hear how much we talk of the Covenant of promiſes, and what great encouragements there are from it, and yet what a careleſs walk, and how unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the great things offered; therefore, if thou be Indenturing with him, delay it not, but accept it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that thou be for him; and not for another; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the <hi>Sundays</hi> Covenanting with him be not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the <hi>Munday.</hi> It was a notable anſwer that one gave to a temptation, when it offered to draw him away from God, it's not lawful, ſaith he, for a man to tempt another mans wife, I am married, and another wifes husband, and it is not lawful for me to tempt another mans wife. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thy walk in reference to the temptation, and the thing thy heart inclines thee to, let them look like thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal engagement and Covenant with God, otherwiſe the thing that is thy great help, ſhall be the greateſt witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and thy Judge ſhall tell thee before all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> thou art a perſon condemned out of thy own mouth.</p>

            <p>THE laſt day I fell on the properties of this duty, of perſonal Covenanting with God, I ſpoke to ſix or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43047:71"/>ſeven, which I will not now reſume; but becauſe it is ſo neceſſary a Theme, and that which the practice of it affords to many that are now in Glory a great deal of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I will yet add three or four properties of this perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenanting with God, before I apply it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> this perſonal Covenanting, the bringing the Covenant particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly home, as made with me, as it ought to have theſe ſix or ſeven things ye heard of the laſt day, ſo in the eighth place, it ought to be very expreſs, diſtinct and formal, it ought not to be a general entering in a Covenant with God, nor a concluſion drawn out of a general, but it ought to be an expreſs, formal, explicite Covenanting with Him. There are two remarkable words ye find <hi>David</hi> have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O my Soul, thou haſt ſaid to the Lord, thou art my God,</hi> compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.3. <hi>Say to my ſoul, I am thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> lay the two together, <hi>David</hi> in perſonal Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, he can give an expreſs account what his ſoul ſaid to God, and what God ſaid to his ſoul; it ought not to be a meer general, or a concluſion drawn out of a general, but it ſhould be very explicite and expreſs; and here I will clear two things, (1.) Wherein ought a Chriſtian, in his perſonal Covenanting with God to be expreſs? And <hi>(2ly,)</hi> ſhall give you ſome grounds why we ought to be ſo expreſs in our perſonal Covenanting with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Wherein ought we to be expreſs in our Covenanting Among many things I will name theſe three, (1.) We ought to be very expreſs in this, that it's a Covenant we make with God; it's not a purpoſe, nor a reſolution that we take up, but it's an expreſs Covenant we make; ye have often heard, that of all tyes, the ty of a Covenant is moſt binding, no man can looſe himſelf nor no ſociety of men can looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ty and obligation of a Covenant with God; Therefore it's remarkable, when the Lord makes over to Believers, the things purchaſed in and by his Sons death, firmly and ſurely, he hath amongſt all other ways, eligible for that end, pitched on making them over by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; he knew well, that of all things that made up a Security, a ſecure right in a Covenant was the moſt firm; ſo when we come to make a Covenant with God, that we may not ſhake our head looſe, as often we do in purpoſes, we ought to be very expreſs in it; this that ye I do, and that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43047:72"/>which I tranſact, it's a formal Covenant, which contains the ſtrongeſt tye; It's not a purpoſe, nor a reſolution only, but it's a formal and expreſs Covenant, which is neceſſary to be adverted unto, becauſe many at Sacraments, and when they come under the Spirits convictions, they come under purpoſes, and poſſibly ſome kind of vows, and they ſlip as haſtly from them again; whereas, if they were expreſs in this, that it is a formal Covenant the ſoul enters into with God, the obligation would readily appear more binding. <hi>(2ly,)</hi> As we are to be expreſs in this that it's a Covenant we tranſact with God, that afterward we may remember, ſuch a day I not only purpoſed, reſolved, and vowed, but I Covenanted with God. In the ſecond place, we are to be expreſs in the terms on which we Covenant: and here ye would notice two things, (1.) We are to be expreſs in the things we bind our ſelves to do. <hi>(2ly,)</hi> We are to be very expreſs in the condition, on which we bind our ſelves to do theſe things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are to be expreſs in the things we are to do, it's true we are not to make new duties, nor to put in terms that are not in the Covenant already; yet there are three particulars, wherein a perſon Covenanting with God ought to ſtudy to be very expreſs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are the great things in the Covenant that we ſhould believe, mourn for ſin, and pray; theſe things are indiſpenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Covenant: therefore when we enter in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant with God, and would be explicite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs about it, we are expreſly to mention the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Covenant on our part, whatever we bind our ſelves to do, If we bind our ſelves in the Covenant, to build the Church, and give our goods to the poor, and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the fire, except theſe great Articles of the Covenant be performed, it's not a Goſpel-Covenant: therefore we ought to be expreſs, in binding our ſelves to theſe great things, indiſpenſibly required by God in the Covenant. <hi>(2ly,)</hi> in a time of tryal, a Chriſtian ſhould be expreſs, in binding himſelf in a perſonal Covenant, to the owning of theſe truths and intereſt, that come to be a caſe of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it's an eaſie thing to owne uncontroverted truths, but theſe things, that in our generation come to be a caſe of confeſſion, theſe intereſts, and people that are moſt born down, we are particularly to Indenture in a perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43047:72"/>with God, eſpecially for the owning of theſe Intereſts: though we are to have reſpect to all his commands, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to theſe that make againſt the errors of the time: It's remarkable, ye find the moſt part of the Prophets wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, runing againſt Idolatry, and the moſt part of Chriſts Sermons runing againſt hypocriſie, the great reaſon of this Is, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s time, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was prone to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and in Chriſt's time, they were overwhelmed with Hypocriſie. <hi>(3ly,)</hi> A Chriſtian ought eſpecially to bind himſelf to theſe duties, at which his careleſs heart is moſt ſloathful, and againſt theſe corruptions he is moſt prone to; every man is weakeſt at ſomething, as <hi>Samſon</hi> had his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wherein his ſtrength lay, ſo every man hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein his weakneſs lyes; and when we perſonally Covenant with God, we ought to be expreſs in it; if one be negligent in Prayer, a wanderer in hearing, if one have a gading, light heart in converſing with God, they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to purpoſe and reſolve, but to caſt over the cord of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, on that levity of ſpirit; ſo when we Covenant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and particularly with God, in theſe three above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, the ſoul ought to be expreſs and particular into it.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, we ought to be expreſs and particular in the conditions on which we bind to theſe things, otherways after our Covenanting with God, which affords a great deal of peace and ſweetneſs to the ſoul, and many of late have gone ſweetly down to the grave, when they have brought out their old perſonal Covenanting with God, and renewed them, and we ought to be expreſs in the conditions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe three. (1.) It's a promiſe of the covenant that God ſhall give ſtrength for performing our part of the covenant, he hath often promiſed this, <hi>The feeble among you ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>as the Angel of God, they ſhall renew their ſtrength, and mount up as an Eagle, they ſhall walk and not to be weary, run and not faint;</hi> now when we bind to the great duties of the Covenant, to the owning the truths and intereſts of the Goſpel, we are to put in that condition, wherein it's promiſed that he will do theſe duties, <hi>viz.</hi> that all our ſtrength muſt flow from him as a River, and that on theſe terms and conditions we bind, providing he give ſtrength; this is the way to make our part of the Covenant, both pleaſant and eaſie, when we can go to Chriſt as our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43047:73"/>Treaſurer, to bring our ſtrength from him, to do what we have Covenanted. <hi>(2ly,)</hi> We are to put in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expreſly, that he will accept of the will and endeavour, in place of perfection; if we were to make a Covenant of Works, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, we were obliged to bind, that we ſhould be perfect in love, and perfect in faith; but in the Covenant of Grace, we are to bind, according to the terming of the Covenant of Grace, the grace of the Covenant hath trade the propoſals of it run in this Channel, he it is alone that works in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure, and he will accept of the will in place of perfection. <hi>(3ly,)</hi> We are to Indenture in this Covenant on theſe terms, that all our failings ſhall be covered with the righteouſneſs of a Cautioner; when we have any challenge for guiltineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant with him, our only recourſe, like <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Wife, the ſecond time that the Angel came to her, ſhe was not accuſtomed to ſpeak to Angels, ſtay till I call my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Covenant holds him out as the only fit perſon to deal with Serpents, whoſe heads he bruiſed: So we are to be expreſs in our Covenanting, that our failings ſhall be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the righteouſnes of a Cautioner; ſo ye ſee, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting with God is not ſo dreadful and ſcarring a thing, as many take it up to be, but it is eaſie and pleaſant, if it be gone about according to the method of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſecond property of this Covenanting with God, ſhall be this, that as it ought to be gone about expreſly, explicitly, and diſtinctly, ſo it ought to be gone about according to the method of the Goſpel, no perſon goes about it rightly, that doth not keep in it the method of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Ye will readily ask, What is it to keep a Goſpel-method, in Covenanting with Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For clearing of this I deſire you may take notice of theſe three things, that make up this Goſpel method, in a ſouls perſonal Covenanting with God (1) The Goſpel-method is kept, when the Law makes way for the Goſpel; I do not deny, but one may enter in a perſonal Covenant with God, that hath not had the Law work to ſuch a hight as others have had; we read of ſome in the Goſpel, that were cut to the heart, before they were brought to believe; ſo here are ſome of them we read of, there is no more but the Lord opened their heart, as the Lord opened the heart
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43047:73"/>of <hi>Lydia,</hi> there is no ſuch acount of their Law-work, as of others, yet this ordinary Goſpel-method, of the Laws making way for the Goſpel, was typified by the ſtinging of the fiery Serpents, before they could look for healing on the braſen Serpent; and readily they will never make a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere perſonal Covenant with God, that have not had the challenges and threatnings of the Law, like an Ax laid to the root of the Tree: It's ordinary for any, when they take up a profeſſion, and readily ſewes a new profeſſion to an old heart, like a new Cloath ſewed to an old Garment, they will preſently enter in a Covenant with God, but it uſes not to be ſicker and laſting, unleſs the Law hath made way for the Goſpel: O but they will come ſweetly and accept his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and bind with him upon any terms, that have been ſitting in priſon, and hath had the ſentence of death in themſelves, and that hath lyen in the Irons, and as it were been hanging over the Pit; it will be but a frothy kind of work the ſoul will perform, when there hath been no Law-work, nor Legal humiliation before. (2.) In this perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenanting, this method is to be kept, that the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſes are to be eyed, in order to our performing the conditional promiſes; when we perſonally Covenant with God, we have to do with a Covenant of promiſes, but the promiſes takes in duties, and in order to the performing the condition, we muſt keep the Goſpel method in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; Lord, I bind my ſelf in this Covenant, to accept of thy Son, and to believe in him, and to take him for my Huſband, but in order to this, ye muſt look on the abſolute promiſes; there is a Spirit of Faith promiſed, there is one holden out to be the Author and Finiſher of Faith, and we never Covenant in a Goſpel method, when we eye not the abſolute promiſes, in order to the performing of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conditional promiſes; as for example, a perſon binds himſelf deliberatly, I am negligent in Prayer, I bind my ſelf againſt negligence, to be more diligent, I am a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wandering in hearing, I bind my ſelf in this Covenant againſt it; they have ſtill an eye to ſome abſolute promiſe where things are promiſed an eye to ſome abſolute promiſe. (3.) Ye ſhall take notice, that every man before he enter in a perſonal Covenant with God, he is in Covenant with death and hell. Remarkable is that word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43047:74"/>the 15th. and 18th. <hi>verſes, Becauſe ye have ſaid, we have made a Covenant with death, and with hell are we at an agreement.</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>And your Covenant with death ſhall be diſanulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not stand, and the overflowing ſcourge ſhall overtake you.</hi> Every natural man is under a Covenant with death and hell; now, when ever we come under a perſonal Covenant with God, that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant muſt be broken: The Covenant is like a Marriage Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt <hi>Hoſea</hi> and the Woman of Fornications, he is comanded to marry a Wife, an Adultereſs, ſaith he to her, thou ſhalt no more play the Harlot, thou ſhalt be for me, and not for another, ſo will I alſo be for thee, then we keep a Goſpel method in a perſonal Covenant with God, when the work of the Law drives the Soul to the Goſpel, and when we eye the abſolute promiſes, in order to the performing the condition of the conditional promiſes, and when we break the Covenant with death and hell, like a Woman that is Married, ſhe gives up with all the reſt of her Wooers, becauſe ſhe is married to another; ſo in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting with God, there muſt be a bidding <hi>Adieu</hi> to all the reſt of the Suiters, and we muſt break Covenant with death, and hell, and luſts, for we are now married, and become another Mans Wife, and readily, the thing that was but Fornication before, will be Adultery now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And laſtly, This perſonal Covenanting with God, ought to be compleat, it ought not to have limitations and reſervations, but it ought to be compleat and entire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Readily ye will aſk, How is this perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God compleat, and in what reſpect is it ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I might inſtance many reſervations, that any would make, when they come to indenture in a perſonal Covenant with God, but I ſhall rather chuſe to ſhew you three things, wherein this act of perſonal Covenanting with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes intire and compleat. 1. When we give our ſelves wholly to Chriſt, when we give and Covenant our All to him. 2. When we are content in a Covenant, to take Chriſt for All. And 3. When we are content in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to take all Chriſt, as he is offered to us, theſe three makes a compleat Covenanting with him, and in a perſonal Covenant, when the Soul proceeds not diſſemblingly, but ſincerely, it's content to make it compleat in all the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43047:74"/>three. Firſt, When we are content to Covenant, to give our ſelves all wholly to him, our life, our liberty, we are content to be diſpoſed of, as ye were hearing, as to our lot in the world, yea, as to our ſervice; ſome he calls to one piece of ſervice ſome to another; ſome he calls to do, others he calls to ſuffer, and when the Soul is content, wholly to give it ſelf, and its concernment up to him, that he may take their life if he pleaſe, their liberty if he pleaſe, and whether he calls for doing, or ſuffering, according as he calls, we Covenant to obey him. Many Covenant with him, and they have reſervations of ſome one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but when we indeed Covenant as Chriſtians, we are to give up our ſelves wholly to him. 2. We are to take him for all, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.25. He that hath made this perſonal Covenant, ſings it over to him, <hi>Whom have in heaven but thee, and on the earth whom I deſire beſides thee?</hi> He hath taken him for his all, he is ſatisfaction to all his deſires; if there were nothing left him but God, as the man ſaid, <hi>there is nothing left me but God,</hi> and then he chideth himſelf, <hi>and but God, and what would I have more?</hi> When we are content to take Chriſt for all, for wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption, and ſatisfaction to all deſires, then the Covenant is compleat. 3. When we are content to take all Chriſt, as he is offered, not only the merit of his death, but the authority of his laws, as a King, we are content to be ſubject to the workings of the Spirit, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, for conſclation, to convictions, to lay our ſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, to receive theſe influences, and impreſſions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the Covenant is compleat when all the three are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thus I have run through the Doctrinal part of this Head, of perſonal Covenanting, and have laboured to open it up, as fully as I could, in the nature of it, and grounds and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it. I will only break in on the practical part at this time, and make way for following it in the afternoon.</p>

Is it a Duty thus perſonally to Covenant with God? then certainly it muſt be a great ſin to neglect it, the neglecting of this perſonal Covenanting, and indenturing with God, muſt be a very great guiltineſs; by the Law of contraries, if
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43047:75"/>the one be a duty, the neglect of it muſt be a ſin; many has never laid the guilt of not entring in a perſonal, particular, expreſs Covenant with God to heart; readily there are ſome, who have come under ſome general confuſed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and poſſibly under ſome vows to God, but to go and firmly ſtate a Covenant, wherein they indenture to accept of the offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and to bind to the terms, on which the offer is made, without altering of any of the terms; how few take up this for a guilt, yet certainly there is a great deal of guilt in it, if ye ſhall take a view of the five or ſix Grounds, that I brought this day fourthnight, to prove the neceſſity of perſonal Covenanting with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without reſuming any of them, I do exhort all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that are hearing this Sermon, that they would be convinced, that the neglect of this is a very provocking guiltineſs againſt God; yea it's a mother ſin, and it's a nurſe to other ſins, if thou knew what it were perſonally to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, readily there would not be ſo much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of morning Prayer, and Family Worſhip, and there would not be ſo much liberty taken in your walk, the bond of the Covenant would reſtrain thee; nay, it's not only a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin, and a nurſe to other ſins, but it's the higheſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front that can be given to God, who offers his Son in the Goſpel, and thou has never given a particular and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acceptance of him.</p>

            <p>AN Hiſtorical Faith, ſuch as the Devils have, who <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and tremble,</hi> will aſſent to this truth, That God hath made a Covenant; but it requires a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and juſtifying Faith, to put to theſe two word with it, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43047:75"/>have handled the Doctrinal part of this great Duty, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting; and now I come to the practical part; I began in the Forenoon with an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Information of five or ſix Branches. 1. Is it a Duty perſonally to Covenant with God? then the neglect of it muſt be a ſin, every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to a Duty is a Sin, it's indeed a ſin of the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, however many that are challenged by a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for other ſins, do not ponder it, it's a mother ſin, and an affronting of the Father in his Son. But 2. If this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting be a Duty, then it's no preſumption per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to Covenant with God; it is well obſerved by ſome practical Divines, there are many things, that it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in us to require them of God, but it's no preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do them, when they are commanded of God; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for us to have dreamed of ſuch a thing, as that the Son ſhould marry us, that the Spirit ſhould dwell in us, and that we ſhould have ſuch a Covenant of Promiſes, it had been preſumption in us to require them; but being made Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it cannot be made preſumption in us to obey them; there are many ſtand at a perſonal Covenanting with God, what, ſo great a God, ſo great offers as himſelf, and his Son, and to be made ruler over all that he hath: but ſince his liberal heart, hath not only offered them, but hath commanded us, under the pain of his diſpleaſure, it can be no preſumption to obey, though I confeſs, it had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive to require them. 3. Is it a Duty perſonally and particularly to Covenant with him, then it neceſſarly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that our duty is our honour; a very great priviledge, what, God to be our God, and to be in Covenant with him, to be able to take up the Bible, and read that part of the verſe, which is agreeing to our caſe, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> what greater priviledge than this? <hi>Saul</hi> made an offer of his Daughter in marriage to <hi>David,</hi> he was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following his Fathers ſheep, <hi>Seemeth it a ſmall thing to you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to be Son in law to a King?</hi> But the offer made it <hi>David</hi>'s duty to imbrace the offer, and the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and his duty became his Priviledge.</p>
            <p>And here ye would notice two Things by the way. 1. That it is remarkable, that the great duties of the Goſpel, are not meer Service, but a Chriſtians greateſt Honour; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, delighting in God, walking with him, rejoycing in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43047:76"/>him, are not meer Service, but a Priviledge, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to be obſerved by ſome, who think, if they win at their duties, they are advanced to great honour, and they take up the want of them, as their Affliction; theſe are thy Duty, and the want of them is thy Sin. But there are others, that take up the duties of the Goſpel, as their duty, but they go about them Toyling and Wreſtling, but they take them not up as their Priviledge, and yet they are both woven through other, and our Duty is our greateſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 4. If this perſonal Covenanting with God be a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then we are not to Diſput, whether we ſhould enter in this Covenant or not; commanded Duties ſhould not be Diſput, he is not a Servant, that thinks he underſtands himſelf ſo well, that if his Maſter command him to go, or to come, that will ſtand and debate with himſelf, whether it is moſt convenient for me to go, or to come? the Maſters will is to determine him in this; it's ordinary for us, we are more in diſputing our Duty, than in doing our Duty, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly debating this Queſtion, and that Queſtion, and our converſe together, is more in diſputing, than in helping one another to do; but that which is duty, ſhould not be diſput; readily the adverſary, (if one be about this Duty of perſonal Covenanting with God,) will bring in this, and that, and a third thing, but not to lay by the duty, yet to delay it, but this is duty, and it's a notable evidence of a faithful Servant to his Lord and Maſter, that will not diſput his Duty, but will make all the inquiry how he ſhould do it. 5. If it be a Duty thus perſonally to Covenant with God, then we are not to ſtand on Events, about our duty, for where ever there is duty, we are not to conſider Events, the great reaſon that Schollars give of this, ſay they, when God commanded the duty he foreſaw the Events, and it's a reflection upon his Wiſdom, to think he would engage his People in Duty, and not care for them in the Even; ſome need not be careful about the Event, why? We are clear about our Duty. Now if this perſonal Covenanting be, as it's proven to be, a Duty, for us to ſit down, and calculat, as with Counters, this will coſt me ſo much doing, and that will coſt me ſo much ſuffering, no, in the matter of Duty, we are not to debate the Event, he that commanded the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, foreſaw the Event before he commanded it, and we are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43047:76"/>to leave the ordering of the Event to him, O! ſays one; if I Covenant with him, I will look for a harſh life of it; ſays another, I will never be able to wade through the things I ſee, if I ingage in a perſonal Covenant with him; all theſe things ſhould be referred to him, who commanded the Duty. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If this be a Duty perſonally to Covenant, it informs us, that certainly theſe who Indenture with him, will get ſtrongth to perform, for they are about a duty, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, the failings that adhere to our corrupted nature may accompany us in the Duty, yet if they be not wilfull failings, but that they be in ſincerity, minding their duty, the caſe will be, as if a Father call to a Child, to give him a Glaſs of Wine, and the Child takes the Glaſs, and throws, it in a paſſion on the Ground, and breaks it, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Father will be angry at him, and ſcourge him; but if the Child take the Glaſs, and fill the Wine, but his ſhaking arm lets the Glaſs fall, readily the Father will pity him, becauſe it is an infirmity accompanying his arm. There are in our performing Duties, many infirmities accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Arm, we will not get it perfectly done, but the Arm will ſhake, and let the Glaſs fall, yet if we ſet ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Duty, we will get ſtrength to perform; <hi>They that wait on the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength.</hi> All theſe Uſes of Information, follows from this natively, that this perſonal Covenanting with God, is a duty, it's no Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, it's a Commanded Duty, it's the great Duty of the Goſpel, it is on the matter all one with Believing; it's no preſumption to Covenant with him. But I inſiſt not on this, there are ſome moe ſpecial and practical Improvements of it, than this general; Therefore I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To a Second Uſe of Information, Is this perſonal Covenanting with God a duty, and ſo great a duty, as is proven, then be exhorted to Covenant with him; I have preſſed you before, to go home and do it, and not delay it, and to make it as expreſs and diſtinct, as to the Terms, as ye can; and either with writing, or ſaying it over to God, as that place ye heard cited, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44. <hi>One ſhall ſay, and another ſubſcribe with his hand, I am the Lords.</hi> But this Uſe of Exhortation, that I may the more diſtinctly handle it, I ſhall follow it, with Reference to two ſorts of Perſons in the viſible Church, and in this place, who have need of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43047:77"/>Exhortation. 1. There is a multitude of carnal careleſs Profeſſors, that readily are at the pains, to wait on Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and the Externals of Religion, are punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but for perſonal Covenanting with God for ever, having done any thing of this kind, they are great ſtrangers to it. That I may at leaſt, leave a conviction on theſe, I will ſpeak a word to two things. 1. What are the things that hinders the generality from this, of perſonal Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with God? 2. What is their miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Firſt, What is it that hinders the generality from this perſonal Covenanting with God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Among many things, I will name theſe Four.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A great many underſtand not the nature of the Covenant, they are in the eſtate of nature, they are under the Covenant of Works; it's a truth beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, all natural men, however they may be viſibly under the Covenant of Grace, they are really under the Covenant of Works; they are in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore they are under his Covenant, until they be really unite and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Chriſt: the Covenant is the Contract, and until we marry the Man, we have no right to the Contract, now the generality underſtand not the miſery and danger of this Covenant, they conſider not that it's a Covenant, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires perfect and perſonal obedience, they are under a Covenant, if they fail in the leaſt, they muſt be damned for it; however they cry to Chriſt, and die hoping in Chriſt, yet their Covenant admits not of a Chriſt, nor of a Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; nay, the Covenant they are under, admits not of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: It's remarkable, the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> was on theſe terms, in <hi>the day thou eats, thou ſhalt die;</hi> it's not ſaid, in the day thou eats, <hi>if thou repent, thou may be ſpared;</hi> no, it admits of no Rpentance, if <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould ſeek the bleſſing with tears, he cannot have it, he rews that he had ſold his birth-right, but he could not obtain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, though he ſought it with tears: even <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency, could not keep this Covenant, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality conſider not the miſery of it, but were it pondered as becomes men, that in a little will meet in the Valley of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and reckon before the Tribunal of God, for ye are under a Covenant, that admits not of a Chriſt, nor Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor of Repentance, but it requires perſonal and perfect
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43047:77"/>obedience; if it were ſeriouſly pondered, O! what pains there would be, to get a Covenant made with God through the Son. 2. The generality do neglect this perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God, becauſe other things take up their time, it is very remarkable, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.2, 3, and 4. <hi>Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David;</hi> but what goes before? <hi>why ſpend ye your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not?</hi> There is the impediment, that hinders many from entring into this perſonal Covenant, they are ſo taken up, ſpending their money for that which is not Bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfies not, that their ear is not inclined to hearken unto this everlaſting Covenant with Chriſt; readily the thing hinders you, from perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, that hindered <hi>Martha</hi> from hearing Chriſt, ſhe was buſie taken up in the houſe; <hi>Martha,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>thou art troubled about many things:</hi> and very lawful things, may be ſinful hinderances, in the way of this Covenanting. It's remarkable, the perſons that ſent the Anſwer to the Maſter of the wedding, when he ſent out his ſervants to invite them, the one of them ſays not, I have a Whore, I cannot come; another ſays not, I have a drunken lawing to count, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come; but one of them ſays, I have a Farm; another, I have a yoke of oxen; another, I have a Marriage, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come; all the three were lawful things, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſinful hinderances, in the way of coming to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. No, the truth is, earthly-mindedneſs lyes in the way of many, in this place of perſonal Covenanting with Chriſt, <hi>They ſpend their money, for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> 3. A third impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way of the generality, in making this perſonal Covenanting with God, it's this, they are like a Woman that is already married, marrying another Huſband, <hi>They have made a covenant with death, and with hell are they at an agreemet,</hi> as ye heard cited from <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28. It's true, That is <hi>making lies their refuge,</hi> as it's called in that ſame place; yet they cannot break that Covenant, they cannot break the Covenant they have made with their Luſts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are inclining to break it, they are oftentimes like a ſleepy Servant in a houſe, the Maſter calls him, he will
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43047:78"/>cry, coming, and immediatly falls a ſleep again: ſeveral times, they will break that Covenant with their Luſts, but that is but like the morning Dew, or an early Cloud, like <hi>Ephraims</hi> goodneſs, it ſoon goes away, they cry, coming, and then falls a ſleep: Now, the great impediment of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, that hinders them from perſonal Covenanting, there is a Covenant driven, and roved, and ſubſcribed, and Sealed with Death, and Hell, and Luſts; and they cannot break this Covenant, they cannot ſhake it off. <hi>Lastly,</hi> It impeds the greateſt part, the generality their entering in this perſonal Covenant with Chriſt; fear of difficulties, if they ſhall Indenture with him, they muſt reſolve with the Croſs, they know indeed, there is much good gotten with him, but there is evil alſo; there are Reproaches, and Croſſes, as ſome of the Heathens profeſſed to the Primitive Chriſtians, that they could imbrace the Goſpel, but they could not burn for it; but, as we have ſaid, where there is a Queſtion about the duty, we are to leave the Events to him, that hath commanded the Duty; for he hath commanded no duty, but he foreſaw the Events, and will regulat them, and yet ordinarily, we cannot truſt him with Events: Theſe things makes among many, that may be brought, that the generality of natural men, and the generality of them that are living in the viſible Church, they reſt on the Covenant of Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord, but to take them to conſider their miſery they are under, by continuing in their natural eſtate; and what intanglements from the World, lyes in their way, and what a difficulty it is, to break the Covenant with Death and Hell, and that they ſhould leave Events to the Lord: they cannot look through them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go on in the houſe of their pilgrimage, from twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old to thirty, and from thirty to ſixty, and like ſheep they are laid in the Grave, and Death hath Dominion over them: theſe are the impediments that the generality have lying in the way, of perſonal Covenanting with God.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, There are ſome that go an higher length, beyond theſe that I have ſpoken to; it may be they come under ſome implicit Covenant with God, that dare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver venture on an expreſs, formal, ſtated Covenant with him, either to ſubſcribe with his hand, or to lift it up, as ſome that make perſonal Covenants will do, or to open the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43047:78"/>mouth, by ſome ſolemn engagement to him, they dare not come this length, and there are three or four things, uſe to ly in their way, and I would gladly caſt up the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and remove the ſtumbling blocks, that ly in their way. 1. Sometimes before we can truſt God, we would have ſurer pledges from him than his Word; It's a difficult thing to live the life of Faith, and very often his People would have ſome ſenſe and experience, before they can perſonally Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God; like <hi>Thomas,</hi> he would not believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſaw the print of the nails; and yet he came at length to do it, <hi>Thou art my God, and my Lord,</hi> ſays he; this was a great injury done to him, but he had to do with one, that could ſoon forgive injuries; it was a great wrong, not to believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt, he had been often told of it before, and yet I will not believe untill I ſee the print of the nails, and put my hand in the holes of his ſide; and readily many of his People, before they Indenture and Covenant with him, they would have ſome ſenſible Proofs and Experience of his Covenant, I will not believe, while I ſee the print of the nails, before I can ſay, <hi>my Lord, and my God;</hi> this was a great injury, <hi>but he hath magnified his Word above all his Name,</hi> and yet oftentimes, when we think of perſonal Covenanting, we cannot credit the Word of him who cannot lie: This ſeveral times keeps back his People from perſonal Covenanting, they can tell, O! ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſuch a ſure one, and ſuch Promiſes as are in it, and made by a God that cannot lie, O ſay they, I ſee not the print of the nails, the hole in the ſide, and therefore they refuſe perſonally to Covenant, until they get ſuch a meaſure of Senſe. It's juſt that they go mourning over the want of it. 2. Sometimes his People refuſe thus to Covenant perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with him, becauſe they miſtake the Work of the Law, and the Conviction of the Spirit, accompanying the Law, frequently if the Law, like a Sword put in the Spirits hand, begin to wound, they preſently think, there is no more for them, but to dwell on ſorrow; or like <hi>Jacob,</hi> if they ſhould live to gray hairs, they ſhould go down to the Grave with ſorrow, for ordinarily the Spirit and the Law wound together, and it's ſtrange, to ſee the thing, that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to drive to perſonal Covenanting with him, ſhould be the thing, that ſhould hinder us from it: The great end
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43047:79"/>why the Spirit takes the Law, and convinces and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it's no to drive us from the Covenant, the great end of the Law is, to be a School-maſter to lead us to Chriſt, it was evil Logick in <hi>Peter</hi> to ſay, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man;</hi> it was far more ſuitable to have ſaid, come to me, for I am a ſinful man; this readily hinders many from coming to Chriſt, and perſonally to Covenant with him, they think it ſuits beſt with them, to cheriſh the Challenges of the Spirit, and Convictions of the Law, and to dwell on them, if it were to go to the Grave, with no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than what that hath produced, altogether miſtaking the deſign of the Spirit, which is in all theſe Convictions, and Work of the Law, to drive us to a perſonal Covenant with him. But 3. A third impediment, that lyes in the way of this perſonal Covenanting, it's this, many a time theſe who would go about it, they account the things in the Covenant ſo far above them, that they cannot offer to claim at them; what, ſay they, God to be their God, and Glory to be theirs, himſelf to be theirs, and to be made Ruler over all that he hath; oftentimes this keeps many of his People from perſonal Covenanting with him; they are like ſome weak eye, that is daſled with looking upon the Sun, the Sun is ſo bright; the things offered in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are ſo great, that in a manner, they put out their eyes; As I hinted at already, indeed it had been preſumption in us, to have required them, but it is none to obey them, when they are commanded; it had been great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Peter,</hi> to have come to Chriſt, and ſaid, Lard, waſh my feet, but it was a great ſin in <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt girded himſelf with a Towel, and came to waſh his feet, for him to ſay, thou ſhalt never waſh my feet, Chriſt takes him ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up for it, <hi>If I waſh thee not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thou haſt neither part nor portion in me.</hi> Frequently we look on the things of the Covenant, as ſo great and ſo far above us, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſonally Covenant with him, whereas it's above thy Fathers Houſe, and all thy Kin, to require them, but ſince thou art commanded, and threatned with Hell, except thou perſonally Covenant, there cannot be any preſumption in it. 4. A great many who would incline to this perſonal Covenant, are hindred by this great impediment, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Temptations, many of which I could name, but I
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43047:79"/>will only ſay this now, ſince it is this uſe of Exhortation that I am on, I would exhort you to go about this work of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting, all ye that are in nature, and are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with this, that ye would have more from Chriſt nor his bare Word, or the Covenant, or ye that are miſtaken with the Law, or any of you that think the Covenant above you, or that are hindred with diſcouraging temptations, I exhort you to go home, and make this perſonal Covenant, and I ſhall only ſay theſe three or four Words about it. 1. I would exhort thee to take ſome time for conſidering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with thy ſelf, I delight to read the Books of ſome, that write of perſonal Covenanting, to read of their Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, to ſit down and conſider, it's not long ſince I came into the World, and it will not be long before I be out of it, and wherefore came I into the World? Are theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Word of God? If they be, I muſt either hearken unto them, or elſe be damned; if I be in a Covenant of works, I am under a Covenant, that admits of no Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, no Repentance, and if there be the leaſt fail, it will bring me to Hell; but here I ſee another Covenant of Grace, but if I enter in this Covenant, I muſt be holy, or then I will be eternally damned, and there is a Spirit of Faith, and Prayer, and Repentance, will be given me: now will ye take time, and confer theſe things with your own heart, 2. I exhort you, in order to the putting of this in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Chriſtian, to carry it on by prayer, when ye go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, ye may warrantably ſay to God, Lord, I am preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from yonder Pulpit, to make this Ingagement and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, and I am told the method that I muſt keep, muſt be, to wait on thy ſtrength, to wait on the abſolute Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, therefore go to him, and pray for ſtrength, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhmet of the Promiſe, and it will be a ſweet evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that thou wilt get it, if thou get liberty to ſeek it by Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>He hath prepared my heart to ſeek him, and he hath cauſed his ear to hear;</hi> the caſe is with thee, as with a Man that hath a Petition to give to a Prince, if the Man ſit down to write it, and the Prince bid him put in this and that in it, it is an evidence that he will grant it. 3. I exhort thee even to uſe ſome ſolemnity in entring this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, either by writing it down, or ſubſcribing it with the hand, or lifting up the hand, or ſome ſolemn uttering
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43047:80"/>the words, that the next day, when anything bids thee break thy Covenant that is dear to thee, as nothing could be dearer to thee, than <hi>Jephthah</hi>'s Daughter was to him, ſay as he ſaid, O! <hi>my danghter, thou art a trouble unto me,</hi> what is the matter, <hi>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and how can I go back.</hi>

            <p>THE laſt day I ſpoke to an uſe of Information, and proved, that this perſonal and particular Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was a duty, and the neglect of it was a ſin, and that our duty was our priviledge, and that it was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to enter in this Covenant; without further re-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pituation, I ſhall proceed to the ſecond Uſe.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If perſonal Covenanting with God be a duty, as is proven and cleared, then it ſerves for Exhortation, to ſtir up all of you thus perſonally to Covenant with God; it's not only a duty, but as I have proven it, it's the great duty of the Goſpel, all other duties without this, are unacceptable, we can neither lay claim to Chriſt, nor to the priviledges of the Covenant, until we thus perſonally and particularly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with him.</p>
            <p>Before I preſs this Uſe, that I may in the Afternoon more perſwaſively follow it on you, that ye would thus perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly Covenant with God; I will in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inſiſt two things. (1.) I will remove ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Impediments, that ly in the way of the Souls perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenanting with God. (2.) I will open ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that will follow on the doing of it; the truth is, in ſo neceſſary a duty, we are to do as ſome that Write the Jewiſh Hiſtories tell us, that the Magiſtrats throughout all the Land, they were obliged to have the high ways plain, and Bridges over the Waters, and the ſtones removed out
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43047:80"/>of the high way that led to the City of Refuge, that he that fled from the avenger of blood, might have no ſtop in his way; I would do this in handling this duty of perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, and among many, I ſhall pitch on four or five impediments that ly in the way, and prove obſtructions, notwithſtanding all the Sermons that ye have heard on it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It may be ſaid, Shall I thus perſonally and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Covenant, to accept of Chriſt, and Indenture and vow and ſwear to the terms of the Covenant, ſince I know not if I be an Elect? Election is a fundamental priviledge, and if that be wanting, all that we do in this, is but like a houſe without a foundation; one might as well go and Sow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Land, and build a Houſe on another mans Ground, that hath no Bond, nor Charter, nor Seaſin, nor any other Right to it, as a Reprobat can go and plead the priviledges of the Elect; and I know not if I be an Elect, and therefore ſhall I go make a perſonal and particular Covenant with God? This is indeed a very natural Objection; but I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to conſider theſe three or four things, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to remove it. (1.) Know, that Election is not the ground, or the clearing about the ground of our believing and cloſing with Chriſt; in the Covenant we are not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on this ground, I am an Elect, and I will cloſe with Chriſt in the Covenant, and make a perſonal Covenant with him; but rather our cloſing with him is a <hi>Medium</hi> or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove our Election; we are not to proceed on this method, I will firſt be clear of my Charter, Election, and of the purpoſe of God, before I build on this ground, no, we are firſt to build on this foundation, and then to be clear of Election; for though Election be firſt in the order of Chriſts working, Calling is firſt in the order of our knowledge, and we muſt firſt know that we are called, before we know that we are Elected. (2.) Conſider this, where will ye find in Scripture, that ever God ſecluded man from any promiſe in the Covenant, merely becauſe the were not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? He hath indeed ſecluded many, becauſe they were not Believers, and becauſe they were ſcandalous, and hypocrites, but in all the Bible ye will never find him ſeclude any, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they were reprobats, why ſhould we go to put in an exception, where he makes none? It's not our Election, or Reprobation, that is made an impediment in all the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43047:81"/>Bible, againſt our being bettered by Chriſt, our unbelief may be one, but our Election is none. (3.) Ye would notice this, that the debate about our Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is very impertinent, before our Effectual Calling, and cloſing with Chriſt in a perſonal Covenant. It's obſerved by School-men, that there are only three ways poſſible for a man to know his Election, there is the reading of the Book of Gods Decrees, the Revelation of the Spirit, and thirdly, the fruits of Election, appearing in the progreſs of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; now the firſt two are impoſſible for us; we cannot read the Books of Gods Decrees, we cannot tell who are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or who are Reprobate, out of the Book of his Decrees, we cannot tell the Revelations of the Spirit, becauſe our Effectual Calling, it may convince and challenge, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reveal, therefore it remains, that it muſt be the third, which cannot be, until we perſonally Covenant with Chriſt. So, to diſpute our Election before we Indenture with him, and to ſay, I will not Covenant with him, for I am not an Elect, thou muſt have underſtanding, to read the Book of Gods Decrees, and to have the Revelation of the Spirit. (4.) Conſider, that our Election is not our duty, it's our priviledge, but not our duty, we cannot elect our ſelves, a ſervant in an houſe, is not bound to be moſt taken up about his maſters ſecret thoughts, the thing he is moſt to be taken up about, is his maſters command, and that what he hath bidden him do; we cannot elect our ſelves, God hath not commanded it. Now when we are perſonally Covenanting with Chriſt, it's not our duty to enquire about things that are not our duty, God hath commanded us to accept of his Son on the Terms offered, and for us to refuſe, for a thing that he hath never commanded to be our duty; we cannot be ſure of Election, until we perſonally and particularly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, we may like a Huſband-man know, that it is the Spring time, by the ſpringing of the graſs, he knows it not by the poſition of the Heaven, but by the ſpringing of the Graſs and Herbs, ſo we would be clear of Election: and I would warn Chriſtians of this, when Satan hath a mind to bring a perſon under the neglect of ſome duty, he will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily puzzle them with Queſtions of Election, or Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Robber, that will ride with a man in a fair high way, and not wrong him, but will wait until he get him in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43047:81"/>ſome Wood, or ſome Den, and then he will aſſault him: Now the Queſtion of Election and Reprobation, is like a Wood, or a Den, and the Tempter hath a great advantage, when he aſſaults about theſe. Therefore ſince Election is not our duty, but our priviledge, and ſince we cannot know it, before we perſonally Covenant; it ought to be no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thee, ſuppoſe thou be in the dark about thy Election, and not be able to tell thine own heart and thy neighbours, I know not if I be an Elect, and if I perſonally Covenant with him, I am but like a man that is going to build upon another mans ground, that hath neither Bond nor Charter; but thou follows not the Goſpel-method, which is firſt to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, and then to be clear about thy Election.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Objection that I ſuppoſe will ly in the way, in hearkning to the Sermons that ye have heard; I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding guilty, and ſhall I owne God to be my God? Doth not the 50 <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſay, <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in thy mouth, ſeing thou hates to he reformed?</hi> Shall I take this Covenant in my mouth, when I have ſuch a heart, and ſuch a way? Readily all the aggravations of guilt, and all the threatnings againſt it, they come never to be more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, than when we are called to ſome ſpecial duty; the challenges about guilt, will let us alone at one time, that will follow us at a Sacrament, or ſome ſolemn Ordinance, and when we ſhould perſonally covenant with him. For removing of this impediment, I would have thee firſt in the general, notice, that to ſtand at perſonal covenanting with God, becauſe thou art guilty, is very like <hi>Peters</hi> Argument, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man;</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> Argument is, like as a Patient ſhould ſay to a Phyſician, depart from me, for I am ſick: Why ſaid he to him who was called Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, becauſe He ſhould ſave His people from their ſins, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more particularly to this, thy guilt can be no rational impediment in the way of thy entering in this perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, on theſe conſiderations. (1.) Know, that never any entered in this Covenant, but guilty perſons. <hi>Adam</hi> that was an innocent man, came not under the Covenant of Grace, until he became guilty; and it had been unſuitable for <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo long as he was innocent: never any came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Covenant but guilty perſons; and ſometime they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43047:82"/>that came under it, were among the moſt guilty: the like of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> of <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> ſo that thou miſtakes the nature of this Covenant, that will ſtand at Indenturing and ſubſcribing to the Lord, becauſe thou art guilty, for it's a Covenant made for the guilty, and it would not have agreed to <hi>Adam</hi> when innocent. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> Thou would notice, that the Covenant expreſly mentions the pardon of all guilt except one, it's a large word, it's true it's a dreadful word, but it is exceeding comfortable, <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven, except the ſin against the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> there is neither Adultery, Murther, Swearing, Lying, nor Drunkenneſs excepted, but only this ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, why ſhould thou put in excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where God hath put none? If a Prince ſhould come and ſuit a Maid in a Cottage, and ſhe ſhould tell him, I am black and poor; but if he can diſpenſe with her blackneſs and poverty, why ſhould ſhe make an objection of it? <hi>(3ly.)</hi> I would have thee to ponder, that Chriſts righteouſneſs it's a ſufficient ſatisfaction for the ſins of all the Elect, how great ſoever thy guilt be, it's not ſo great as the ſins of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; grant thou be the greateſt ſinner among all the Elect, yet thy ſin is not ſo great, as the ſins of all the Elect; Chriſts righteouſneſs is as the Ocean, that if a man could lift a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and caſt it into the Sea, the Waters could go over the top of it; now would any think, that the Water that covers a Mountain, would not cover a Peeble-ſtone? Admit thy ſin be amongſt the greateſt of the Elects, <hi>Paul</hi> when he calls himſelf the chief of ſinners, he ſays not, he is greater than all ſinners; but take in the ſins of all the Elect, Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is ſufficient for them all, and that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for all, is it not ſufficient for thee? So guilt can be no exception to refuſe perſonally to Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>A third Objection, ſay ſome, though it be neither my Election, nor my guilt, that can hinder me perſonally to Covenant with God, yet I cannot come under the Bond of the Covenant, for in one Chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. I find the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and they that come under this Covenant, they meet with <hi>cruel mockings, and ſcornings, torturings, ſawn aſunder, quench the violence of fires, ſtop the mouths of Lyons;</hi> and ſhall I come under a perſonal Covenant, when I bind my ſelf to all theſe things? For anſwer to this, it's true, in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43047:82"/>Covenant he deals ſo faithfully that hath made it, that he hath concealed none of theſe, but rather laid them out to the outmoſt; and many come under a perſonal Covenant with him, that comes not under the half of theſe things; but ſuppoſe thy perſonal covenanting with him, ſhould bring thee under theſe, ſince it is a time, wherein covenanting with Him may bring people under the Croſs, I would have thee conſider four or five things. 1. Conſider the Croſs as a teſtimony for Chriſt. It's remarkable 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. that the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Corinthians Chriſts Epistle,</hi> his meaning is, they are Chriſts Teſtimonial, he is ſpeaking before of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Commendation, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Ye are Chriſts Epiſtle:</hi> What is the meaning of that? Ye are a commendation to Chriſt; when Chriſt calls out his ſervants to do or ſuffer, they bear teſtimony to the Goſpel, they are like Letters of Commendation, teſtifying, that the Goſpel is true, and Chriſt is glorious, and all the loſs a man ſuſtains for the Goſpel, Chriſt makes it up. It's a wonder, that the moſt part of Chriſts followers have not renounced him before this day; they have had cruel mockings and ſcourgings, and the reſt ſpoken in that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. If they were not made up ſome other way, they would renounce him; the Martyrs have before all the World, teſtified, that they that ſerve Chriſt, have ſomething from him that makes up all their loſſes; he puts a great honour on us, when he puts us to ſuffer, many die Miniſters, who do not die Martyrs; <hi>Luther</hi> the night before he died, wept that he was not a Martyr: did we underſtand the honour that is put upon us by ſuffering, we would not do as <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the Lord is ſending him to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he is unwilling to go, ſays he to God, I am not elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, I cannot ſpeak, ſend by whom thou wilt; and yet of all the honour that ever was put upon him, it was one of the greateſt, and the thing that makes him famous this day, and eminent in glory, was the honour that was put upon him, in going down to <hi>Egypt:</hi> Therefore, we ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline perſonal Covenanting becauſe of the Croſs. <hi>2ly.</hi> Though it be true, that this Covenant provides the Croſs, and they that enter in it, will meet with it, yet conſider the Croſs as an evidence of our Adoption; not only as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Goſpel, but as an evidence of Adoption, Heb. 12.8. <hi>If ye be without correction, whereof all are partakers,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43047:83"/>then are ye baſtards, and not ſons.</hi> Mark here, the Evidence of a ſon, if ye come under correction; Divines ſay, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, if we have the ſame ſpirit that Chriſt had, if we be patient, and ſubmiſſive, as Chriſt was, then we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are ſons alſo of Chriſt; Chriſt met with the Croſs, and endured patiently, nay, the out-lettings of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, never more than under the Croſs, he is never more tender, than under the Croſs, <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſts on you,</hi> he ſays not the Spirit of grace, but glory: Many a time Chriſt doth with his out-lettings, as men do with Candles and Fire, frequently his out-lettings are greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs, and he lights his Candle ordinarly to his Elect when in the dark, and kindles his Fire and comforts them under the Croſs. Now ſince the Croſs is ſuch an evidence of Adoption, and ſuch a teſtimony of the Goſpel, what wonder, it ſhould be no impediment in our way of covenanting with Chriſt? <hi>3ly.</hi> However, if ye perſonally Covenant with Chriſt, ye may forecaſt with Croſs. Yet thirdly conſider, whan an excellent help the Croſs is to mortifie corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Iſai. 27.9. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquitie of Jacob be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin:</hi> Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nothing contributes ſo much to curb corruption, as the Croſs; It's an Obſervation of a Divine, if ye heard Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians complaining one to another, I have an evil heart, I have Unbelief, I have Pride, I have Paſſion, and if ye heard them go to God in a corner, they will have ſo many complaints of themſelves, and yet when God ſends the Executioner, the Croſs to kill theſe Malefactors, they take ill with it; the Croſs is ſent for that end, to kill corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and to remove pride, and earthly mindedneſs, and ſenſuality; and yet when the Executioner comes, we take ill with it. What a deal of folly is it, to be mourning for the thing that we cannot endure to have killed? Such Children are we, and ſo far from underſtanding, that we will go to God and complain, and complain to our chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Friends, and yet when the Executioner comes, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to have it killed? But when we take up the Croſs, as an Executioner come, to take away pride and earthly mindedneſs, and ſenſuality, readily we will make the Croſs welcome. <hi>4ly.</hi> Conſider the croſs, as that which may promove our Glory; the more of the Croſs for Chriſt, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43047:83"/>more eminent degree of Glory; the more of pleaſure in time, the more of torment after time. I will caft up a word to you that ye have written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. He is there ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of fornications; and in the <hi>7th. verſe,</hi> ſaith, <hi>How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her.</hi> It was ſo in Gods dealing with <hi>Dives,</hi> when he came to the place of the damned. By the Law of contraries, how much of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how much of grief and affliction for Chriſt, readily ſo much the more glory; and therefore in this ſame Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> though all that are in Glory, walk with white; yet they that were beheaded for the cauſe of Chriſt, are termed by <hi>John,</hi> to <hi>walk in long white robes;</hi> now, did we take up the croſs of Chriſt under theſe four conſiderations, it would never hinder us perſonally to Indenture with Chriſt: Did we take up the Croſs as a Teſtimony to the Goſpel, as an Evidence of our Adoption, as an Executioner to kill the corruptions, we mourn over, and as a Preſage, that we will wear the long white robe, when we come to Glory: readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we will never ſtand at this, I will not enter into a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, for I ſee what is the reſult of it, it's the Croſs; but ſince theſe things are ſo, it's a wonder rather, that we do not ſeek after it.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43047:84"/>three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some may ſay, I cannot thus perſonally Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt, for fear of the want of perſeverance, it's a dreadful thing, to be ay binding, and ay breaking, and it's a great aggravation of our guilt, when we walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Vows and Engagements to God, better not bind, than break again. This Objection lies in the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and for removing of it, I deſire you may take notice of theſe four things. 1. When the queſtion is about our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we are not to argue from events againſt our duty; it was excellently reaſoned in Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> when ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, it was her duty to go to the King, and plead for her people the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhe ſends word to <hi>Merdeca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, I will go to the King, if I periſh, I periſh;</hi> ſhe will not bring an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the event, againſt her duty: if perſonal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God be a duty, the argument taken from the event is very improper, when it's brought againſt a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>2ly.</hi> I would have you to notice, that in reference to Perſeverance, there are two kinds of Promiſes in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 1. There are Promiſes made to Perſeverance. <hi>2ly.</hi> There are Promiſes made of Perſeverance; theſe two are diligently to be noticed: There are ſome Promiſes made to Perſeverance, Heb. 3.6. <hi>We are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope, firm unto the end:</hi> There are ſome Promiſes made or Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>I will put my fear in their heart, that they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me.</hi> Now when we Covenant with God, we are diligently to eye both theſe kinds of Promiſes: There are Promiſes made to Faith, and Promiſes made of Faith, and if ye be ſtaggered at this covenanting with God, for fear ye do not perſevere, remember that the Covenant contains Promiſes of perſeverance. <hi>3ly.</hi> I would have you to notice, That as God in our Election, decreed our effectual Calling, ſo he decreed the reviving and quickning of Grace in us, when it comes under decays, Pſal. 23. <hi>He reſtoreth my ſoul:</hi> Ye find him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. Brought in, <hi>building up that which is broken, ſtrengthening that which is weak.</hi> He revives Grace, as well as quickens that which is dead: ſeveral times his people have fallen under decays, as a Tree in Winter, that hath neither Leaves nor Flouriſhes; an evil time, and an erroneous opinion, and a ſtrong temptation, may bring his people under decays, that they have no might to perſevere;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43047:84"/>but he muſt bind up that which is broken, and reſtore it: ſo, if they ſit down and ſay, all thoſe Sermons on perſonal Covenanting, will not influence me to Covenant with him, for I will but bind and break, and play faſt and looſe with him, thou argues from events againſt a duty, thou ſhould go to the King, even though thou ſhould periſh; and the Covenant thou binds now to, binds thee to Perſeverance; and though there be decays in thy ſpiritual lot, yet he will bind that which is broken, and ſtrengthen that which is weak, and reſtore the ſoul, and make a <hi>David</hi> Pen the 51. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> after he went in to <hi>Bathſheba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth Objection againſt this way of perſonal Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is this; ſome readily ſtand at perſonal Covenanting with God, there are ſo many Duties required in it, I muſt pray continually, I muſt rejoyce always, I muſt deny my ſelf, I muſt not love the World; theſe are all Terms in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and my heart will never ſubſcribe to theſe; if the Covenant run on theſe Terms, is it not better for me, not to bind at all, than to do the thing my heart will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto; if I contract with God on theſe Terms, I am like a man marrying a woman that I do not love; for removing of this, I would have you to notice theſe three or four things. 1. As there are many duties required in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo there is abundance of ſtrength for obeying them; we have little more to do, than ask and have, nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is more given than we can ask; the Lord deals with many that uſe to go to Him in prayer, as <hi>Naaman</hi> did with <hi>Gehazi,</hi> when he ran after him, and ſaid, <hi>ſend my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a talent, for he hath need of money, I pray thee, ſays he, be content, take two;</hi> ſo, the Father of the Prodigal did with his Son, when he returned, <hi>make me, ſays he, as one of thy hired ſervants;</hi> the Father ſays, <hi>bring forth the beſt rob, and kill the fatted calf, put a ring on his hand, and ſhoes on his feet;</hi> There is more offered in the Covenant, than we have an appetite to deſire, and what need have we to ſcar at duty, when we bake beſide meal, and have offered us in Chriſt, more than is required? <hi>2ly.</hi> Take notice, though there be many duties required in the Covenant, yet duty is our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour; the bleſſed Angels account ſo of it, they are thrice in the <hi>Bible</hi> called Angels, where they are once cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Spirits; Angel is a name of Office, but Spirit is a name
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43047:85"/>of nature, and they glory more to have their names record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Duty, than from their Nature; there is no greater honour than duty; now, to be ſcarred from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal covenanting with God, when there is a talent, more nor required in the Covenant, and when Duty is our greateſt honour, what an unreaſonable exception were this, to ſtand at perſonal covenanting! <hi>3ly.</hi> Take notice, that the Duties ye bind to, in this perſonal covenanting with God, ay the longer ye perform them, they will be the more eaſie and pleaſant; it's remarkable, <hi>David,</hi> a man exerciſed with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Duties, <hi>I had more joy in thy testimonies, than in all riches;</hi> if ſome men had been commanded to compare Riches and the Teſtimonies, they would have been far from giving <hi>Davids</hi> Teſtimony, <hi>but he would meditat on his laws day and night, he will riſe at midnight and praiſe him, he will water his couch with tears, his ſore will run in the night;</hi> when others were ſleeping, he was about the Tract of his Duty, and he came to this at length, <hi>I had more joy in thee, than in all riches.</hi> the greateſt part of them that quarrel, and find no pleaſure in Duty, are they that are not exerciſed with performing Duties; ſo we need not ſtand at perſonal Covenanting on this ſcore, that there are many Duties required; for not only do we bake beſide meal, and have ſtrength for performing Duties, but ay the longer we perform them, they are the ſweeter and eaſier. <hi>4ly.</hi> Though we bind to the Terms and Duties of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet he with whom we bind, will accept of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in place of perfection; he will take the Will for the Deed, many a time hath he done ſo with his people; I have given you ſeveral Reaſons why he doth ſo, for he gets the full payment from Chriſt; if ye will accept Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, he will do with you, as with a man coming to a Regiſter to get up a Bond, he deſires that the Bond may be given him, and that he may have it freely, in regard the Cautioner hath payed the full Sum; when we go to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, we may plead he will accept of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in place of Perfection, the reaſon is, the Cautioner hath payed the full Sum.</p>
            <p>The laſt and great Objection againſt this perſonal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, is, readily ſome may ſay, I cannot Covenant nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture with Him, for I ſuſpect if I do it, I ſhall do it Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically, and I have been hearing, it muſt be a Cordial,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43047:85"/>ferious work, and if I go, and make a perſonal Covenant Hypocritically with him, he will break out on me with his wrath; it were better leaving it undone, than to do it Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically; do I not hear Sincerity indiſpenſibly required to it, and he will paſs by many things, before he paſs by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrifie; and if I go and make a formal, heartleſs, and not an upright Covenant with Him, it were better leaving it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. I confeſs, what it is they give the Hypocrite in this, I have determined in an Argument before, that all within the viſible Church, are obliged perſonally to Covenant with Him, they being bound to believe and accept of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as it is offered; yet in this caſe, it's difficult what to ſay, for ſince it is indiſpenſibly required, and to go draw a perſonal Covenant, and ſubſcribe it, and atteſt God, and lift up the hand, and yet do it Hypocritically, is it not better to leave it undone? Therefore I ſhall anſwer this in doing theſe three things. 1. By ſhewing you, that there are ſome who will very boldly and confidently Covenant with God, and in effect, they are doing nothing but playing the Hypocrite in it, and diſſembling, they may bring many things to prove that they are not Hypocrites in it, and I would encounter two or three of them. 1. Say ſome, I am no Hypocrite, for I abhor Hypocriſie, I cannot endure it in another, and can I be guilty of the thing that I abhor? <hi>Judah</hi> was very ſevere againſt <hi>Tamar</hi> his daughter in Law, when he heard ſhe was with Child, <hi>bring her forth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and burn her; David</hi> was very ſevere againſt the man that took his neighbours Lamb, when he had an hundred ſheep of his own, <hi>verily he ſhall die,</hi> yet both of them were guilty of the Sin that they condemned. Divines obſerve, there may be ſeveral motives that may make many condemn Sin in others, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in themſelves. In the <hi>2d.</hi> place, ſome will ſay, I am bold in affliction; <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, and fear takes hold of the Hypocrite,</hi> but I am not ſo, I am bold in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; this will not prove it either, for there is a <hi>Roman</hi> courage, a natural courage, that may be far from the Truth of Grace, ye have evidence of ſeveral in Scripture and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, who hath been ſo; but ſays ſome, I am much in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Duty, I pray, I read the Scriptures; but Hypocriſie is like the <hi>Egyptian Frogs</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> it will even be in our Bed-chambers; he that ſtudies to pacifie his Conſcience,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43047:86"/>and keep it quiet, will be much in ſecret duty; on that principle, thou may ſay, I love not Drunkenneſs, nor Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor whoring, I love not the Scandals my heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to, and therefore I am not an Hypocrite; but our Luſts are like the Sea, they ebb and flow, the Sea loſes not it's power of flowing, when it's ebbing; there may be ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining luſt, that yet hath not killed it, thou may taſte of the powers of the life to come, and yet be an Hypocrite; ſo ſome may Covenant with God Hypocritically, and on ſhallow grounds conclude themſelves no Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some ſtand at Covenanting with Him, for fear of Hypocriſie, they are too lightly brought to conclude themſelves Hypocrites, and there are Two or Three things makes Believers to do ſo. 1. Sayes ſome, if God ſaw me not to be an Hypocrite, He would not toſſe me and continue the Rod ſo long, nor hide himſelf from me under the Rod, as he doth; this was the Argument that <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends brought, to prove him an Hypocrite, that God had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rod with him; but this is no ground to prove thee an Hypocrite at all, thou could eaſily anſwer this, in the caſe of another, and by the way, it's remarkable to ſee, how one Chriſtian will eaſily louſe another Chriſtians Doubts, that when the ſame Doubts occures in their own caſe, they will be overwhelmed with them: thou knows affliction and Sincerity may go together, and though affliction ly long on, and thou ly long in the furnace, it may ſay, that thou has much Droſs, but thou art no Hypocrite. The Lord will do ſometimes with his People in Afflictions, as Phyſicians do with their Patients, He will ſometimes give them Purges, and ſometimes gives them Cordials; when thou art under the Croſs, its the time of thy Purging, but afterwards comes thy Cordial. Others ſay, they are Hypocrites, for they ſay, they are under decays, Grace grows, and decayes again, and muſt they not be Hypocrites, that are ſo? But every decay of Grace will not prove thee a Hypocrite; an Apple-tree may continue to be a Tree, though it have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apple nor Leaf on it; the beſt of Chriſtians have their Summer and Winter, Decayes and Growings; So there may be great miſtakes, about Hypocriſie and Sincerity; ſome have obſerved it well, ordinarly Satan, who is a liar and a deceiver, tempts ordinarily, to things contrary to Truth,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43047:86"/>he will perſwade the Hypocrite, that he is ſincere, and on the contrair, he wil perſwade the ſincere Chriſtian, that he is a Hypocrite; therefore, if thou ſtand at perſonal Covenanting with God on that Score, that thou art a Hypocrite, and cannot Covenant with Him, know that there is nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, than miſtakes about Hypocriſie and Sincerity, many concluding themſelves ſincere, that God will ſend to Hell, and many concluding themſelves Hypocrites that are ſincere.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, to make this matter clear and plain, it concerns thee to try in thy covenanting with God, whether thou be ſincere and upright, and I will offer thee three Marks whereby to try it. 1. Sincerity where it is, it aims at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it may be known by it's aims; the ſame word in the Hebrew that ſignifies Perfect, ſignifies Sincere, and ye will find them often convertible in Scripture, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God accepts of Sincerity for Perfection, but Sincerity can never be ſatisfied, until it be perfect; therefore, ye find the moſt part of the exerciſes of the upright run on this, they cannot get Love enough, Faith enough, Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance enough; for Sincerity will ay be complaining, until it be perfect: it's reſembled by a Divine to a young Heir, that is never content though he have meat and cloth in the houſe, until he get the whole Inheritance; for the Mark of Sincerity is, that it's ay complaining, and humbled, becauſe it's not perfect. <hi>2ly.</hi> Sincerity is diſcerned by ſomething in the nature of it, it takes in the Goſpel qualifications, it hath love to Chriſt, as the principle; it hath the glory of Chriſt, as it's motive and end; Sincere, it's <hi>ſine cera,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wax; it has love to Chriſt as the principal Motive, and the glory of Chriſt, as the End of it, that it drives at; and where theſe two concur in our Covenanting with God, we may rationally conclude, that it's not hypocritically done; if we find the love of Chriſt, and the glory of Chriſt, as the two Butts ſet up, the one from which the Arrow comes, the other to which the Arrow drives: and if there be an aiming at perfection, that though we cannot ſay, we perfectly love Chriſt, and believe in Him; yet Sincerity will ay be complaining, until it come to Perfection; if thou find theſe two Characters of Sincerity, thou may conclude, thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting is not Formal and Hypocritical, but that it's done in Uprightneſs and Sincerity. <hi>3ly.</hi> I will ſay this, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43047:87"/>this Doubt, ſuppoſe after all that is ſaid, thou art unclear about Covenanting with Him, for fear thou do it Hypocritically, yet that ought not to hinder thee from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting; and there are two Reaſons for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this. For 1 All that live under the Goſpel, they are bound to accept of the Covenant, and that on the Terms offered; now, Suppoſe thou find not Sincerity in thy covenanting, yet it takes not off the Obligation of the Command, the Command binds thee, if thou be under the offer of the Goſpel, perſonally to Covenant, under the hazard of the eternal wrath of God, whether thou be a Hypocrite or Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; therefore, thou art not to diſpute thy caſe ſo much, as to underſtand the Command. <hi>2ly.</hi> Take notice, That there is in many their Indenturing with Chriſt, that at the firſt have many Selfiſh and Hypocritical-like ends, that after they have covenanted with him, have become ſincere; the caſe is, as with a woman that at the firſt marries a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is rich, but afterward ſhe would not be divorced from him if he were begging; ſeveral times it comes to paſs, that at our firſt Indenturing with him, it will be ſome ſelfiſh end, that the Soul may drive at; but afterward, the Soul would not quite him and renounce him, and give him over, though they had nothing but his Croſs; ſo ye would not ſtand at that, I am not upright and ſincere, as becomes one that would Covenant with God, thou may have ſome ſelfiſh ends at the firſt, but like the woman that marries the man, becauſe he is rich, thou wouldſt not now be divorced from him, but loves him for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I propoſed, in following this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, to ſhow you ſome Advantages that the Soul will have by this perſonal covenanting with him: I have hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſome before, and before I give you the Marks of right perſonal covenanting, I will tell you the Advantages, that are in perſonal covenanting with him, and I will ſay theſe three or four particulars to you. 1. All the good we are to expect from God, muſt come in to us through Jeſus Chriſt, without Him we could expect nothing from Him, but wrath and hell, for we have broken the Covenant of works, and he is infinitely Juſt, he puniſhes Sin by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of nature; But add to this, <hi>2ly.</hi> That all the things we can expect from Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt come in to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43047:87"/>us by the Covenant; what is the ground that one has no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by Chriſt, he is to them <hi>a ſtone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, and they will be broken on him?</hi> And another, they will get peace and pardon by him? It comes in by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they are concerned in the covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are concerned in the covenant of Grace, ſo that as we can have no benefit by the Father, but by the Son, ſo we can have no benefit by the Son, except we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> We can expect no good from the covenant, except we be particularly and perſonally concerned in the covenant; what would it ſignifie for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with Abraham, Iſaac, and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, a Covenant,</hi> if he be not able to ſay, <hi>the Lord hath made with me a Covenant?</hi> So laying theſe three together, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Being particularly concerned in the covenant, all that is in God, and all that is in Chriſt, and all that is in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, becomes ours: O! what a cooling is there in theſe three? I like the Obſervation that one has, on that Word that <hi>David</hi> often uſes, by vertue of this Covenant, <hi>O my God, thou art my God,</hi> ſays he, this Word, <hi>my God,</hi> takes in more, than all the Philoſophers in the World could draw out of it; if he had not explained it himſelf, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living;</hi> Chriſt brings it in to prove the Reſurrection, for, ſays he, I <hi>am not the God of the dead, but of the living;</hi> but there is ſomething in that Word, <hi>my God,</hi> that no Logick can reach, all the Philoſophers on earth, could not have proven the Reſurrection out of that, if he had not done it; it's a ſtrange conſequence, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> willl riſe, therefore the dead will riſe: now he that is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly applying the covenant, hath no leſs made over to Him, than I <hi>will be thy God. 2ly.</hi> A ſecond advantage is, that a Believer may go, and plead the Promiſes of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the mercy of God indeed is a ſweet argument, but the Promiſes are a Debt to him; we may go, and as it were, lay his hand-writ before him, as ſome Antients, that went to pray in a particular place, they would lay the Bible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and point out ſuch a Promiſe, and tell him what he had bound himſelf to; in how many caſes is it advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, to have the Promiſe to plead, when they have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with him? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Suppoſe thou go to God, and plead
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43047:88"/>for Bread, thou has a Family, and thou has Children, and all the toil and ſhift thou can make, cannot ſerve to get them Bread; the Promiſe is, <hi>He remembred his Covenant, and gave them Bread;</hi> ſuppoſe in another caſe, thou go to Him for Pardon, thou art exceeding guilty, it's a ſtrange way, that they that have made a Covenant with him, will take in pleading for Pardon, Pſal. 25. <hi>Pardon mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for it is very great:</hi> the Covenant will admit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of iniquity: They that have accepted the Covenant, and Indentured with him ſincerely, on the Terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, may go and ſeek pardon, for their iniquities are very great, for it's like the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> A third advantage, in time of deſertion, ſuppoſe he be hiding himſelf, and thou cannot tell where he is, nor whether he is gone, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will influence his return; <hi>She that was termed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, ſhall be ſo no more; I have forſaken thee for a little moment, but with everlaſting mercy will I gather thee, is not Zion married to him, are not his walls continually before him? and the mother may forget her ſucking child, but he cannot forget him;</hi> what caſe is there, that we can go to him in prayer, but conſtantly the Argument is taken from the Covenant; and thou that has ſincerely Indentured with him, thou may go as warrantably, and plead the Promiſe, as he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee to thy Duty; though he be a Soveraign Lord, and thou a bit of clay, yet, ſince the Covenant hath made thee a Debtor to thy Duty, the ſame Covenant hath made him a Debtor to his Promiſe; for as thou art bound to the one, he is graciouſly bound to the other, no that thou art to ſuſpend thy Duty until he perform the Promiſe, but thou may preſs the Promiſe as much on him, as he may preſs thy Duty. <hi>3ly.</hi> Thou may lay the Covenant for an excellent ground, to caſt in the Anchor of Hope; without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we might renounce our Hope; I know not what ground of hope we have, abſtracting from the Covenant, we need not, nor Hope never gets a ſurer Anchor than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and what an excellent too-look hath Hope, when one hath accepted the Covenant, to have all that God hath to give, and all the purchaſe of Chriſt, and all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant; may not thou take up thy hope to the top of Mount <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and let it ſee the promiſed Land, that flows with Milk and Honey? and let it ſee the City with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43047:88"/>the twelve Ports, and twelve Foundations, and ſay, all theſe are mine? What an excellent help is it, in all ſtraits of the time, when the time is, that many will think that <hi>Popery</hi> will riſe, and thou may be put to deny Chriſt, or then to ſuffer for him? To be brief, this perſonal covenanting with God, hath ſo many advantages in it, that it's difficult to tell them all; but take theſe three, God makes over himſelf and all that he hath, his Son, and all: thou has the Covenant to plead with him, as he hath the Law to plead with thee; if he charge thee with the Law, and command, what thou in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant has Indentured to obey, then turn back the Promiſe on him, where he hath engaged to fulfil, what thou haſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted; and if thou haſt ſincerely Indentured with him in the Covenant, thou may take a view of the twelve Ports, and the City with the twelve Foundations, and ſay, my Father, and my Fathers Houſe, and all is mine. If any ask, what is the ground of this? Ye have taken hold of the Covenant, and imbraced Chriſt; he hath made over himſelf in his Fulneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of his Son to thee, if thou wilt take hold of his Covenant: therefore go home, if thou haſt the work of ſincere Covenanting with him, thou may go home, and take up for time and eternity, all things of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and at length may ſing, all is mine; and if any ask, what is thy Charter and Right? There it is, I have accepted him, and entered in a Covenant with him, and who can queſtion my Right to theſe?</p>

It's very remarkable, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> Gen. 17. was the ſum of the whole Covenant; So 1 Cor. 6 16. <hi>I will dwell among them, and walk among them, and I will be their God.</hi> This is the thing that theſe that are in Covenant with him have, they have God, and all that is in God to be theirs; but becauſe this General will not ſufficiently open this Priviledge, I would have you to notice theſe three or four things that are in God, that if ye be particularly in Covenant with him, will be yours. <hi>Firſt,</hi> All his Attributes will be yours, his Power, his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nay his Holineſs and Juſtice will be yours; he will be juſt to forgive, as <hi>John</hi> calls him; his Omnipotency, his Goodneſs, his Truth, and all his Attributes will be yours; and they will be yours in the ſame way that they are Chriſts; it's remarkable, when he ſent the Commiſſion to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by <hi>Mary,</hi> he ſent on theſe Terms, <hi>Go, tell my Diſciples; I go to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God;</hi> he is yours in all his Attributes, when ye have to do with his Power, his Holineſs, his Goodneſs, if ye have made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant with him, all his Attributes are yours. <hi>2ly.</hi> All the Relations in which he is holden forth in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are yours; He is your <hi>Husband,</hi> your <hi>Father,</hi> your <hi>Hope,</hi> your <hi>Glory;</hi> it's remarkable, there are a number of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cannot agree to the Angels; it's true, he may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Creator and Maker, but he cannot be called their Husband, nor their Father, with a reference to the work of Redemption: So, if ye be in Covenant with him, as God is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43047:89"/>your God, ſo all his Attributes mentioned in the Covenant are yours, ye may call him your <hi>Power,</hi> your <hi>Rock,</hi> your <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> your <hi>Strength,</hi> your <hi>Strong Tower. 3ly.</hi> If he be yours, all his Diſpenſations are yours; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God;</hi> all Providence, every thing, nay death it ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>All things are yours, life oy deach, things preſent, or to come, all are yours, and Christ is Gods;</hi> even death it ſelf is yours, when ever death comes, if ye be in Covenant with him, it comes like a ſervant to attend you, and carry you home to the place of your reſt; if he be yours, all his Attributes, and Relations, and Providences alſo are yours. <hi>Laſtly.</hi> If he be yours, there is ſomething that ye have, in having him, that no Miniſter nor Angel can tell, nor explain to you; the truth is, if he be yours, the caſe is with you, as if a countrey-man ſhould find a Jewel, and he ſhould go through all the countrey, and let this man and that man ſee it, and ask what it is worth, and there is none that can tell the value of it, except one that is a Jeweler; indeed Chriſt only can explain it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob;</hi> he only can prove the reſurrection from the dead, from that which no Miniſter nor Angel could do; there is no Miniſter nor Angel can tell, what is imported in this, <hi>to have God for our God:</hi> for all the excellencies of the Creatures are imported in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>The Lord is a Sun and a Shield:</hi> He is a Sun for proſperity, and a Shield for adverſity, he is both for Proſperity and Adverſity; the man can never fall wrong, that is in Covenant with God, under no Croſs will he be broken, under no Proſperity will he be blown up; ſo ye that enter in a perſonal Covenant with him, ye will have God to be your God, and if he be your God, all his Attributes, all his Relations are yours, all his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will make for you, and when ye have counted on all the three, ye have ſomewhat in this, <hi>my God,</hi> that no Miniſter nor Angel can explain, and that is the firſt Advantage I offer, by perſonal Covenanting with him, God will be yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By perſonal Covenanting and Indenturing with him, all Chriſts purchaſe will be yours; great things hath he purchaſed, and readily he hath purchaſed no more, than he hath payed for; he hath aboundantly payed for all that he hath gotten; nay, to ſay the truth, he hath payed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43047:90"/>above the value, to give his Blood for the like of us; and for the Glory that he hath now in Heaven, he had as much before, though not properly as Mediator, yet as God Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, and Con-ſubſtantial with the Father; now, all that he hath purchaſed is yours. For clearing this, I will offer you two things to be conſidered. 1. The Covenant of Grace on Chriſt's part is no more, but the execution of his three Offices, as he is King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church; all the Promiſes of the Covenant may be reduced to theſe three: all the promiſes of Pardon, are the execution of his Prieſtly Office; all the promiſes of guiding and Ruling, are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Kingly Office; all the promiſes of teaching, are the execution of his Prophetical Office; the truth is, the whole Covenant is nothing, but the Execution of his Three Offices, for he is left only Executor in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He was both the Teſtator and he is Executor, and muſt fulfil the Legacies left in the Covenant. Now he that hath made a perſonal Covenant with him, he hath a right and Title to all his Offices, and conſequently to all that he hath purchaſed; they may not only count on God as their God, but on the Mediators purchaſe, as their purchaſe. <hi>2ly.</hi> Another thing will evidence the truth of this, in regard all things that Chriſt hath purchaſed, they are all Secured and Ratified by the Covenant; ye have often heard, that God cannot give a greater Security to men, than the Security he makes by way of Covenant; now they that have made a perſonal Covenant with God, they have Security in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for all Chriſts purchaſe; now theſe are advantages aboundantly ſufficient, to bind you to this perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting. But to follow this more particularly, I would have you to take up the Covenant under a Four-fold For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and the taking it up under this Fourfold Formality; will let you ſee more of the advantage of perſonal Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the Covenant as the Conduit, I ſay not the Fountain, but as the Conduit and Channel, of all Sinctifying Grace, through which runs from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Grace, all Sanctifying Grace. <hi>2ly.</hi> Conſider the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as it's an Anſwer to all Challenges and Objections. <hi>3ly.</hi> Conſider the Covenant, as it's a Charter and Security, for the Church of God in general. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Conſider the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as the Charter of our inheritance, for all eternity;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43047:90"/>and under theſe Four Formalities, ye may ſee the advantages, that a perſon hath, who enters in a perſonal Covenant, and takes this everlaſting Covenant, and applyes it to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the Covenant, as the Conduit, through which all Graces runs to us from Chriſt, all Graces runs through the Channel of a Covenant; it's true. Chriſt is the Fountain of Grace, <hi>and of his fulneſs we receive, and Grace for Grace;</hi> but all the Graces that comes from Chriſt, comes to us from the Promiſe; it's remarkable, there is no Grace, whether it be the firſt Grace, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and I will put my fear in their heart;</hi> or whether it be the Grace, that is built on theſe firſt Graces, they are holden out to us in the Covenant; the Grace of effectual calling, the Grace of Sanctification, Adoption, and pardoning Grace; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit that convoyes them all, is the Covenant; the truth is, we can lippen for nothing, for as excellent as Chriſt is, (and O! but he be excellent and good) we can lippen for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but Covenanted things from him; Faith can go no higher than the Covenant, there is indeed ſome that have written, that he will be better at the great day than his word; I will not go to contradict them, I know no Scripture that will contradict them, but I know no ground, for Faith to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing from him, but according to his word; we can lippen for no more, nor Faith can warrantably expect, for no more than what he hath promiſed. So all Grace, the Conduit and Channel through which it runs to us, is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo he that hath made a perſonal Covenant with God, hath in effect laid the pipe to the mouth, through which the water that comes out of the Fountain, is convoyed; all the Graces of the Spirit are promiſed, I know no Grace, but it is promiſed in the Covenant by God; he that hath made a Covenant with God, however Chriſt be the Fountain of Grace, the Covenant is the Conduit and Spout, through which they all run to thee, and thou that makes a perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, layes thy mouth to the pipe, and waits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Fountain of Grace, ſpring Grace to thee; thou art in a fair way to get a new heart, and the pardon of the Sins of thy youth, to get love to God, and patience, and delight in God, for thou art entered in a Covenant, that carries all theſe things from God the Fountain of Grace.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:43047:91"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Covenant, we come to Anſwer all Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges and Objections; there are Three great Things, that keeps Believers humble, and make them go mourning, ſo long as they are out of Heaven, Temptations, Afflictions, and Deſertions, added to their Corruptions, that makes the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them to be full of Briers and Thorns; and he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a perſonal Covenant with God, beſide that he hath his mouth laid to the Conduit of Grace, he hath in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant an Anſwer to all theſe Three Objections; and I would fain know, what any of you, that have not entered in a perſonal Covenant with God, doth, with your Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Croſſes, and Diſertions; it's very evident, all theſe Three are Anſwered in the Covenant: if the Believer meet with Temptations, the Covenant will tell him, <hi>The God of peace ſhall tread Sathan under thy ſeet; ſhortly; and though thy iniquities were like ſcarlet, he ſhall make them white as wool;</hi> If we meet with Affliction, the Covenant will tell thee, <hi>Whom I love, I chaſten and rebuke; and I know, that in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, I have afflicted thee;</hi> If we meet with deſertion, the Covenant will tell thee, <hi>For a little moment I have forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thee, but with everlacting kindneſs will I gather thee; and ſhe that hath been forſaken, ſhall be as if ſhe had not been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</hi> I cannot tell how refreſhful it is, to hear ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, anſwering all their Objections with Scripture; they that take them to the Covenant, and anſwer their Challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Covenant, and bear off their Temptations, Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Deſertions, with ſomething in the Covenant, they take the Goſpel Balm, and it's like their wounds will be healed, when others will apply ſomething, that will gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren and canker them, and make them turn to Error. The Covenant is the only ſolid Anſwers to all Challenges, whether they come from Temptations, or from the Croſs, or ſome Deſertion from God; there is no kindly plaiſter can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to any of theſe wounds, but allenarly the Covenant; now he that enters in a perſon Covenant with God, as he hath laid his mouth to the Pipe, through with the golden oyl run, out of the Fountain, ſo he hath a very cordial Goſpel Balm, for all diſcouragments, whether they come from Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Croſſes, or Deſertions <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as a Charter for the Church of God, and in reference to this, I would have you notice Three or Four Things. 1.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43047:91"/>In the Covenant, we find not only the particular caſes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, their pardon, their taking away the heart of ſtone, but there are greater things promiſed to the Church, that are not yet accompliſhed; the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> an antient Sect, as antient as the Apoſtles time, when they read through theſe propheſies, they thought that Chriſt would come, and receive them perſonally on earth a thouſand years; and the fifty Monarchy men, have run in ſo many fancies about them; but there are great things propheſied, concerning the Church, that are not yet accompliſhed, <hi>That all the earth ſhall be full of the glory of the Lord, and Jeruſalem ſhall again be inhabited, and holineſs ſhall be written on horſes bells;</hi> The meaning of the place is, that the people ſhall be moſtly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up about holineſs, and denyed to their vanities; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is coming, that will ſee theſe dayes, theſe great things that are in the Covenant, and the truth is, theſe things are far greater, than our particular; our pardon, and our peace, is nothing to the caſe of the Church of God, <hi>2ly.</hi> I would have you notice, that he that enters in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenant with God, as I have often told you, he is to take in the caſe of the Church of God, as well as his own particular, he is to take in, that he will mind the caſe of the Church, and ſay, Lord, I will believe all the promiſes concerning the Church, I will accept theſe promiſes, and I will rely on the faithfulneſs of him that made them; and though I be laid in the Grave, I expect that there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration coming, that will ſee all theſe things; I deny not, but we ſhould look to our Mother Church, whereof we are Members, but withall, we ought to take in the caſe of the whole Church, in our perſonal Covenanting with God, ſince the Covenant runs ſo much on the caſe of the Church; it is a ſtrange Covenant that he will make, that will ſeclude the caſe of the Church of God, and ſince he hath made ſo much mention of it in the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> what kind of Covenant is that thou wilt make, that will ſeclude the caſe of the Church of God? So we are to take in this, Lord, I will be an enemy to the Error and Profanity of the time, I will neither be led away with the giddineſs, nor the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, nor profanity of the time; the Covenant is for Truth and Godlineſs, and therefore thou can Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt deluſion and proſanity: and here a great advantage
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43047:92"/>he hath, that enters in a perſonal Covenant with God, in backſliding times, when the wicked are counted happy, and they that work unrighteouſneſs, are ſet up; and when there is ſuch a current of profanity, and as <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſayes, <hi>The beſt are as briers and thorns;</hi> when there are few young ones brought in to Chriſt, and when they who are brought in, we know not what they may turn to, for many turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Error; he that hath entered in a perſonal Covenant with God, he is ſecure; for though he ſee not theſe days, yet as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſt's days a far off, ye may ſee them afar off. O! but it's comfortable to remember, that there will a generation come, when thou art laid in thy Grave, <hi>that will have holineſs written on the horſes bells, and that all will be taught of God, from the meaneſt to the greateſt, and there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd; and the vail will be taken down betwixt them. 3ly.</hi> He that enters in a perſonal Covenant with God, he hath this encouragment, the Covenant takes in the healing of Diviſions among his people; it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, it's often promiſed, it's true, it's long in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>I will give them one way, and one heart, and they ſhall be as one ſtick in my hand;</hi> the time of the fulfilling of the Promiſes is not yet come; no, almoſt as many heads, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opinions; in a time of liberty, it would be difficult for a beginner, how to fix, there are ſuch varieties of Opinions, no wonder the protane multitude Skuriner at all profeſſion; but he that hath made a perſonal Covenant with God, he knows, the Covenant carries this in the boſom of it, <hi>They ſhall be as one ſtick in my hand;</hi> theſe days are coming, though we wait on; now in the perſonal Covenant, he that hath Indentured with God, and given him the hand, however ye may ſee, that there are ſcarce three parts of nynteen parts of the World, Chriſtians, and among theſe three parts, but few Proteſtants, ye he that enters in a perſonal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; hath this, that he may go and ſing, <hi>All the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of God.</hi> and when theſe dayes are come, <hi>they will be like one ſtick in his hand, and they will have one heart, one mind, and one way:</hi> and we may rejoyce as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to ſee Chriſt's day far off; now he that enters in a perſonal Covenant with God, conſiders the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as the Conduit of all Grace, and the immediat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all Challenges, and a Charter for the Church of God,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43047:92"/>when the earth will be full of the knowledge of God, and when they will be like one ſtick in his hand, and when they will have one heart, and one way, and will not be ſaying, here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt; for that is now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in our time, there is one ſaying, Here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt, and one knows not where to ſet down their ſteps, there is ſuch variety of Opinions, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Diviſions. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Take up the Covenant, as the Charter of the inheritance, and ye will ſee what advantage he hath, that hath made a particular Covenant with God; all the glory to come is his; O! but the Cvenant ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently of the Inheritance, take the twenty one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Chapters of the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and read them over, what a ſtately City is there? what ſtately Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? what Porches? and what Trees, that bears twelve manner of Fruits, every moneth, and the Leaves of them are for the dealing of the Notions He that hath entered ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in Covenant with God, according to the qualifications I ſpoke of before, the Covenant carries him with a Legal Right to all that City, let it have never ſuch Foundations and Porches, all the Porches, Trees, and Foundations in it, are all his; Nay, the Tree that is in the midſt of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> that bears the twelve manner of Fruit, is his. Now, ſee what a priviledge it is, to enter in a perſonal Covenant with God. Now take all up theſe Advantages, &amp; I have laid this before you, if not to perſwade you, yet to make you inexcuſable, and to help to bring your Blood upon your own head, if ye enter not in a perſonal Covenant; But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After I have removed the Impediments, and ſhewed the Advantages, there is a third thing, in following this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Exhortation; it ſhal be in exhorting you, to enter this perſonal Covenant; conſider a little the perſons, that are admitted to perſonal Covenanting with God; and generally practique Divines do it, that write of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the perſons that are admitted, may be a great motive, to preſs this Uſe of Exhortation, if he had ſtood at Kings, Princes, the great Ones of the Earth, the Wiſe, the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Holy, and Righteous, and theſe that are exact, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Coneant of Works; but ye would notice four or five things, in the perſons that are called, perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Covenant with God; and I take up this as the great
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43047:93"/>incitment, to preſs this perſonal Covenanting in you. 1. That no former guiltineſs, may hinder you from entering in this perſonal Covenant, nay I ſay more, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt cannot hinder; for if a perſon could conſent to accept of Chriſt, it would not be that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; therefore it's remarkable, they have entered in a perſonal Covenant, with him, that have been the greateſt of Sinners, they have had ſeven Devils, like <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> there have been ſome blaſphemers, like <hi>Paul;</hi> ſome that have killed the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ſtoned them; ſome that were Perſecutors like <hi>Manaſseh,</hi> as thoſe that are mentioned in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that were ſawn aſunder, of whom it was reported, that he did ſaw <hi>Iſaiah</hi> aſunder, with a timber Saw, yet when he was in Bonds in <hi>Babylon,</hi> he repented, and found mercy. That is one thing in regard of the perſons. <hi>2ly.</hi> In entering in this perſonal Covenant, he ſtands not at how mean a birth and parentage perſons be; it's remarkable, <hi>Abraham</hi> with whom he firſt made a Covenant, <hi>a Syrian</hi> to thy Father, and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Amorite; Moſes,</hi> he had his Name <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is drawn out, becauſe he was drawn out among the Flags, he was in a manner a Funling, he is found lying among the Flags by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Daughter, no, he ſtands not at that, but can enter in a Covenant with a <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he be drawn out <hi>3ly.</hi> He ſtands not at the weakneſs of Parts, let one be never ſo ſimple, He ſtands not at that, the twelve Apoſtles are called oft the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our Tranſlation, for reſpect to them, hath i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Men, when they perceived them to be unlearned men, in the Original, they were but poor fiſher men, but that ſtood not in the way of it. <hi>4ly.</hi> He ſtands not at the weakneſs of Faith, if he come to make a perſonal Covenant, he neither ſtands at former guiltineſs, nor the meanneſs of birth, if thou were even a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> laid full of Boils at <hi>Dives</hi> gate; nor at the meanneſt of Parts, nay, nor at the weakneſs of Faith. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He ſtands not at the mixture of Faith with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though thou can ſay, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief;</hi> he is like a man, that if one ſhould ask him? Is it day, he cannot tell, whether it be day or night, he cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Faith be Faith or Unbelief. Now in entering in a perſonal Covenant with God, God will ſtand at none of theſe. Lay all theſe together, and I hope, I may cloſe this uſe of Exhortation, exhorting you all, to take this gate of it, enter
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43047:93"/>in a perſonal Covenant with God, and ſay, and ſubſcribe it with your hand; if ye have not done it, go and do it; ye ſhould be exhorting your own Soul to it, and your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ye that have children, ſhould be preſſing them to do it; Huſbands ſhould be ſaying to their Wives, Come let us return to the Lord, come and let us enter in a perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him; they that hath ſitten all theſe Sermons, and have not advanced one ſtep, I am afraid, they be the Tree, of which it is ſaid, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee henceforth.</hi> ye are daily dying, and going off this Stage, therefore be exhorted, to take you to this perſonal Covenant.</p>

            <p>I Have ſpoken to Two <hi>uſes</hi> of this Doctrine, of perſonal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God, one of Inſtruction, which conſiſted of five or ſix Branches; another of Exhortation, which hath been preſt in ſeveral Sermons, by removing the Impediments, and conſidering the Advantages, of perſonal Covenanting.

For the right management of this Work, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting with God, I have proven the neceſſity of it, opened the Nature and Properties of it, and have cleared many Queſtions about it: Now the Key and Kirnel of Direction follows to be handled; and that I may do it the more diſtinctly and clearly, I will follow it to four ſorts

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> is it a Duty, thus perſonally, and particularly to Covenant with God, then it ſpeaks a word to theſe, who have hitherto neglected, or it may be are ſtill averſe from this Duty, they can count on many things that have occurred in the wilderneſs to them, our never of a perſonal Covenanting with God. I have ſpoken ſome what to this ſort of people before, and may be the ſhorter now, I ſhall only name theſe four things to them, 1 It is already proven, to be a Duty of abſolute neceſſity, the Saints of old have practiſed it, if we believe particular Election, and particular Redemption, and that we ſtand bound perſonally to the Duties of the Covenant that we perſonally, and particularly claim the priviledges of the Covenant, we ſtand obliged, of abſolute neceſſity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and particularly to Covenant to them, I think I have, on ſolid Goſpel Principles proved, that there can be no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by Chriſt, without particular Covenanting with him; thou ownes not thy Baptiſme, thou goes not raſhly about the Sacrament of the Supper, if thou do not particularly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally Indenture with God. I exhort thee to conſider theſe grounds, who has never dreamed of this Duty; all that is in Chriſt, all that is in the Covenant, all that is in the Father, they ſignifie nothing to thee, without a perſonal and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Covenanting with him. <hi>2ly.</hi> I would exhort thee, that has never done it, to conſider the wretchedneſs and miſery of the Covenant that thou art under, until thou particularly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt, according to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace; thou art under the Covenant of Works, Doeſt thou hear? This is a Covenant that admits not of a Cautioner, nor of Repentance, that will not diſpenſe with the ſmalleſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, nor admits not of Sincerity, however thou talk of Chriſt and of Repentance, if thou has not made a particular Covenant with God, according to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, thou art under the Covenant, that admits not of a Chriſt, Repentance, and Sincerity. <hi>3ly.</hi> Thou that has not made this perſonal Covenant, and particularly Indentured, either by Word, or Subſcribing, or lifting up the hand to God, I would have thee conſidering, that there is in thy Lot, ſomewhat that is worſe, than the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, they will not be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43047:94"/>comptable, for the thing that was never revealed, <hi>Tyrus, and Sidon, Sodom, and Gomorrab, the men of Nineveh, will riſe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt thee, for at the preaching of Jonah, they repented:</hi> but thou that lives under the drop of the Goſpel, and hears of a particular and perſonal Indenturing with God, thou ſhall have them coming, from the Eaſt and the Weſt, at the great Day, and they ſhall all be witneſſes againſt thee, for at the preaching of <hi>Jonah, Nineveh</hi> repented, and thou haſt this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant preſſed on thee by the Goſpel, yet thou doſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor make this perſonal Covenant. <hi>4ly.</hi> I would have thee to conſider, that if thou be not in a particular perſonal Covenant with God, thou can lay no claim to the Covenant at all. <hi>Thou art an alien to the common wealth of Iſrael, and a ſtranger to the Covenant of Promiſe;</hi> we muſt either be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inereſted in it, or not at all, it muſt have our ſeveral conſents, or we have no claim to it; thou that has never made this perſonal Covenant with him, and yet art living under the drop of the Goſpel, thou art neglecting a Duty of abſolute neceſſity, thou owns not thy Baptiſm, thou can plead no benefit by the Covenant: if all theſe things will not move thee, I know not what will do it; if thou ſit them out, thou art like to be the Tree, on which fruit never will grow, thou may be fewel for burning, but not for bearing; and I am afraid, there are many ſo, that are ſtanding in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and are Trees for burning, but not for bearing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this was of perſonal Covenanting, ſpeaks a word to a ſecond ſort of Perſons, and that is to thoſe, who come ſome length, but they ſtick in the Birth, and never come up to the full length in this act of particular and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Covenanting with God: There are a great many that do ſo, we have a number of ſober Civilians; ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that write of perſonal Covenanting, they ſay, It's the lot of many perſons of Quality, they go ſome length in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, but they go not the full lenght, length, readily they forſake the pollutions of the World, but comes not the length of giving themſelves over to him according to the Covenant of Grace, in their lot, and ſervice, and condition in the World. I would have ſuch conſidering, for there are many, that ſit down betwixt Towns, betwixt Heaven and Hell: I would have them conſidering three or four
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43047:95"/>things. (1) Thou art in danger to loſe two Worlds; If thou take this preſent World, for thy happineſs, why ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fills not thou thy luſts in it? If thou take the World to come for thy Portion, why walks thou not ſuitable to thy Hope? It's a lamentable thing, many they will find, they loſe both Heaven and Earth, they have been denied to the pleaſures of the Fleſh, and yet for not going a greater length, they have loſt Heaven alſo, often Hypocrites do ſo, and the generality of ſober Civilians, that comes not up the length the Goſpels calls for, but comes ſome length, they are like to loſe both this World, and that which is to come. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> I would have thee conſidering, thou that comes ſome length, that there are many, who have been almoſt Chriſtians, that have all their life ſtruk at that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi> and eternally periſhed in it; the famous <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a friend of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> could tell <hi>Paul,</hi> thou almoſt perſwads me to be a Chriſtian, would to God, ſays he, not only <hi>almost</hi> but <hi>altogether,</hi> thou were ſuch as I am except theſe bonds. I will recommend thee to a Book on that Text, <hi>The almoſt Chriſtian,</hi> many of you have need of that, what does it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to be almoſt, and not altogether one? Thou had as good renounce it altogether, as to be almoſt, and not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Chriſtian. <hi>(3ly.)</hi> Conſider thou that comes ſome length, in this perſonal Covenanting, what a fooliſh bargain haſt thou made with Chriſt, to agree with him in many Articles, and to be content to pay many things, and to break off the bargain for a penny: it's a buſineſs of a Heaven and of a Hell, and thou that would make a Covenant with him. I ſhall not be a Drunkard, I ſhall not be a Swearer, I ſhall wait on the Ordinances, I ſhall pray in Secret, and in my Family; but for the inward Luſts of my heart, and ſecret walk with God, I dare not Covenant for that; there thou has offered fair for Heaven, and art like to loſe it for a little, he that is the Author of the Practice of Piety, he brings in many, that are in Hell, ſaying, O but I was near heaven, and did many things, and ſuffered many things for him, and yet I am here; that agregges their Torment and their Miſery, Readily, thou may have gone a great length, yet it may be, it encourage thy blaſphemy againſt him, in the place of the damned, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> thou has done many things, and ſuffered many things, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thing is lacking
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43047:95"/>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> I would have thee Conſider, that thou that art ſitten down in an <hi>Almoſt,</hi> on this Motive, that thou readily thinks, at Death, or ſome period of Time, or another, thou will come to do it <hi>Altogether;</hi> Thou would know, if thou ſit ſuch a Sermon on it, as this, it ſhall be denied to thee at Death, if thou ſit this afternoon, and do not reſolve, to take Him on the Terms he offers himſelf; if thou wilfully harden thy ſelf againſt all theſe things, thou ſhalt have enough to do, to wreſtle with the Fever, when it comes, thou may be roving, and loſe the Compoſure of thy Spirit, and the thing thou wilt not do now, ſhal be denied thee then; Therefore, thou that art come up almoſt to do it, I have removed the Objections out of thy way, know, if thou hope to do it afterwards, and will not do it now, in the day of thy diſtreſs, or at Death, it ſhal be denied to thee, and thou ſhal die, either Roving, or Sleeping, or Stupid, and ſhall be laid in the Grave like a Sheep: Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has come up almoſt to Covenant, but not altogether, but hopes, there will come a Better day afterwards, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, if thou refuſe it this Night, and go not home thus to Indenture with him, on the Terms you have heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Roving, Stupidity, or Preſumption, will deprive thee of it, when thou art lying on the Bed of languiſhing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is it thus a Duty perſonally to Covenant with God, then it ſpeaks a word to them, who have done it, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again; They find they have a heart ſo ſlppery, that it will bind the day, and break the morrow; unto theſe I would ſay three or four things, 1. Thou that haſt Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and Broken, I would inform thee, that ay when we break, God does not break, it would never be called an Everlaſting Covenant, if it had only a reference to us; it might be called an Hourly Covenant, a Daily Covenant, a Diurnal kind of a Covenant, but not an Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; The thing that makes it be called an Everlaſting Covenant is, the Everlaſting Faithfulneſs of God, it is ſo contrived, as tho we break, if we believe not, yet he abides Faithful; now, when he enters in a Marriage Covenant, the Contract is not like the Clauſes of the Marriage, betwixt a Man and a Woman, if one of the Parties commit Adultery, the Law provides a Divorce, <hi>Thou haſt played the Harlot with many Lovers yet return to me, for I am married to thee. 2ly.</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:43047:96"/>I would have thee, that has Covenanted with God and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to mind, that in the Covenant there are promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, Renewing, Reſtoring, and of binding up that which is broken, and ſtrengthning that which is weak; it would never have been Everlaſting, if there were not ſuch Articles in it; So that if thou has broken, thou art not to run from the Covenant, but thou art to take thee to ſuch promiſes of it, as concern thy Caſe; all the Promiſes relating to Reviving, Reſtoring, Renewing, healing that which is broken, and ſtrengthening that which is weal, It's a great failing in many precious to God, when they find they have made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and broken it, they reſolve to make no mo but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give it over; In that caſe they are to go, and ſeek out ſuch Promiſes, as relare to Reſtoring, Reviving, Renewing, binding up that which is broken, and ſtrengthning that which is weak, other ways the Covenant could never be an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> I exhort thee, who have broken, to go mournfully, and plead the Promiſes; if thou do it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, It's like thou has no Claim to theſe Promiſes; there are many when they fall, they preſently talk of Chriſt, and of the Covenant, and before ever the Plaiſter be applyed, the Sore is heal; the Plaiſter of Reviving Grace, nothing makes it ſtick better to, nor Tears. If thou ſhalt go and take the Plaiſter, and apply it to the breach of Covenant, and not mingle in Tears with it, the Plaiſter will not ſtick, there is nothing that makes it ſtick ſo well, as Tears flowing from a contrite heart; Therefore, thou that has broken Covenant with him, and are guilty of this Sin, which many of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are guilty of, thou haſt Indentured with Him, and dealt deceitfully in his Covenant; go, and apply theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant of Reviving, Reſtoring, Renewing, and binding up; but know, that nothing will make the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſtick ſo well to, as Tears; if you do it preſumptuouſly, thou may apply the Plaiſter, but in a moment it will fall off. <hi>4ly.</hi> Thou that has broken Covenant with Him, and Indentur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and art afraid to hazard again, know this, that burnt Bairns fire dreads, the thing that occaſioned the breach of Covenant, eſhew that; I will offer you two or three things, that uſes ordinarly to bring Perſons, that uſes to Covenant with God, under a breach of Covenant. 1. Ordinarly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and careleſs performance of ſecret Duties; thou goes to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43047:96"/>God, and it's words without Life or Spirit, that thou vents to God in prayer, thou will ſoon break all they Vows, if there grow a dryneſs betwixt the Root and the Branches, the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will ſoon wither; It's remarkable, that which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> he was miſtaken in <hi>Job,</hi> but the Word he ſpake was true, had it not been applyed to <hi>Job's</hi> caſe, he thought <hi>Job</hi> ſpoke unreverently of God, and he took him for an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and he thought all his Arguments reflected on God, and when he had heard him out, ſurely ſayes he, <hi>thou restraineſt Prayer, and caſtest off Fear,</hi> his meaning is, therefore thou may ſay any thing thou thinks, overly performing of prayer, will ſoon bring one to break all their Vows. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's given by ſome Divines, as one of the Reaſons of breaking Covenant with god, unprofitable Converſe among Chriſtians, every Chriſtian meeting with another, ſhould be like a man going to light a Candle in another Houſe, where he knows there is fire, when we uſe to Converſe together, there is nothing of God in it, nothing of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings; readily we may grow careleſs of our Covenants with God; It's a great fault among many, I know whether it be Ingnorance, or the want of matter within, that occaſions it, if one ſhould begin a ſpiritual Subject, they will give it no kind of Intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſilence, they will ſit graver poſſibly at that time, than at another, and hear, but they give it no kind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; thou art refuſing to light thy Candle, at thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours fire, and readily thou wilt break thy Covenant wiht God, to be brief, I exhort thee who has broken thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to take the Promiſes of Reviving, Renewing, Reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of healing that which is broken, ſtrengthning that which is Weak, and lay them to ſore, with the Tear in thy Eye, for nothing will make the Plaiſter ſtick ſo well, as Tears mingled with a contrite heart.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſort of Perſons, to whom I will ſpeak, and therewith cloſe with this Theam, and it is to thoſe, that has Covenanted with Him, they have made a Covenant with him by ſacrifice, and would gladly know ſome Advice how to keep it, that they be not guilty of the ſins aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their time, of being breakers of Covenant with Him, That I may not let thee go, without ſome word of Advice, who art ſerious, how thou ſhall get it keeped, I ſhall for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43047:97"/>preſent give thee theſe two words of Advice, Firſt, if thou would keep this Covenant with God, look well to thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>2ly.</hi> Look well to thy Converſation.</p>
            <p>Firſt. If thou would keep this Covenant with God, look well to thy Conſcience, it's Gods Deputie within thee, and the immediat Judge of all thy actions; and here I would ſhew you, that a Man looks well to his Conſcience, when he looks to theſe three things in it; 1. When he looks to have his Conſcience well informed, the Conſcience is a blind Guid, it's the candle of the Word that muſt regulat it, therefore ye will find a conſcientions Chriſtian, he is always waiting on the Word, waiting on Sermons, and propoſing Doubts; and the great Reaſon of all is, to get the Conſcience well informed; therefore if the Conſcience be blind, and decline to Errour, as often it will do, it will ſometimes call the thing a Duty, that God calls Sin, and that Sin, which God calls Duty; therefore, if thou would keep Covenant with God, look well to thy Conſcience, that it be well informed, and regulate by the word of truth, that thou make not a Duty, when there is none. In this time I am afraid, many are taken away from their Obligations to Him, through an ill informed Conſcience; Conſcience may err on the right hand, there are many make more Duties than God hath made, it may make that Duty which God has never made one; It may Err in the leſt hand, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on Dity, and proſtituting Duties to Luſts, and if thou have not a well informed Conſcience, all thy running through the Wilderneſs is to no purpoſe. I believe all Papiſts, Turks and Quakers out-ſtrip us, there are no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons takes leſs pains to come to Heaven, than proteſtants; therefore, if thou would keep thy Covenant with God, in ſuch a time, when there are ſome ſaying, Here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt, and many falling into Errours, both on the right hand, and on the left hand, labour to have thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience well informed. <hi>2ly.</hi> Look to thy Conſcience in this that it be kept tender, all the light in thy Conſeience, will not keep thy Vows and Covenants to God, if it be not keeped tender; It's a ſingular Character of <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s ſincerity, that he weeped, when he heard the Book of the Law read; <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſs ſent him word, <hi>becauſe thy heart was tender,</hi> if thou would look well to thy conſcience, look well
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43047:97"/>that it be well informed, and then that it be tender: there are ſome ye may drive Carts and Wains over their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, they will not crack, and of all Plagues this is the greateſt. <hi>3ly.</hi> Hearken to the voice of thy Conſcience, do not ſit it out. when Conſcience preſſes on thee. <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his caſes of Conſcience, ſays, <hi>He that reſiſts his Conſcience, or what he takes to be the mind of God in the Conſcience, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts God, becauſe it is the mind of God, for he takes it up as the mind of God, in ſuch a time;</hi> No man ought to follow another mans Light, but to follow the Dictats of his own Conſcience; many are like the old Prophet, and the young, the young Prophet comes to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and denounces woes againſt it; the Lord ſaid, <hi>See thou turn not aſide to the right hand or to the left hand, to eat or drink;</hi> The old Prophet comes to him, and ſays, <hi>turn in with me, and eat Bread,</hi> he follows the old Prophets Light, and goes with him, and there comes out a <hi>Lyon</hi> and tears him: So labour, firſt to have the Conſcience well informed, and then that it be tender, that ye may not drive Carts and Wains over it. And <hi>3ly.</hi> Heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the voice of the Conſcience, for it's Gods Deputy: a man will never keep a perſonal Covenant with God, that looks not to theſe three.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as ye would look to your Conſcience, ſo look to your Converſation; there are many things that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar to be ſpoken to here, our ſecret Walk, oru family Walk, our publick Walk, comparing them with the Rules of the Goſpel; It would take a long time to go through them, I will cloſe all with theſe two words, and ſhall ſay no more. 1. I have long longed to handle this Head of perſonal covenanting, ye have now heard four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Sermons on it, the Stones of theſe Walls, and the Timber of this Houſe, God himſelf and his holy Angels ſhall be witneſſes againſt you, if ye do not perſonally Covenant with him: for, in ſo far as I know the mind of God has been delivered truly to you, and all of you your ſelves ſhall be witneſſes againſt other, if ye fall not on this work of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenanting with God; I know nothing would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bribute more to make you ſerious Chriſtians, then the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, and if ye have not done it, go and do it, ſubſcribe your Name, life up your hand to God, if ye delay it, and expects ſome better time, remember a Fever, a Flux, or a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43047:98"/>Scrubie, will ſtop the flux of your glaſs, and if you delay until death, either Roving, or Stupidity ſhall carry you to to the Grave; Therefore, let one go and ſay, I am the Lords, and another ſubſcribe, and call himſelf by the name of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. 2ly,</hi> if ye will go and do it, all by-gones ſhall be by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones, and all former Tranſgreſſions ſhall be paſt; nay, if ye were never ſo poor, never ſo ſimple, never ſo Ignorant, if ye were of never ſo mean a Birth, of never ſuch mean Parts, if ye had never ſo weak a Father, if ye had never ſuch a mixture of Corruption with it, if ye will but ſay, I am the Lords, and from this time forth, will Covenant to take him, as he is offered in the Goſpel, and do the Duties that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant requires, the Bargain is made, and it's ſubſcribing, it's an everlaſting Covenant, and as ye have made an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant, ye ſhall have an everlaſting Name, ſo long as God is God; and this Covenant ſhall bring you to the place, where ye ſhall be made a Pillar in the Temple of God, and ye know, a Pillar laſts as long as the houſe ſtands.</p>

            <p>THE third particular in this part of the verſe remains, which is the aſſurance that <hi>David</hi> had, that he was perſonally Covenanted with God, he can affirm it, and ſet it down in the Bible, and make it a part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Scripture. <hi>The Lord has made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant.</hi> ſo that this being the third thing, I ſhall take this third Note, and therewith cloſe this ſecond Branch of the verſe, and the Note is this.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>That not only does God take Believers in a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant with Him, but they may be clear, aſſured, and able to affirm it, that God has made a Covenant with them,</hi> This aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43047:98"/>
               <hi>David</hi> hath here, and the Spirit of God doth ſo agree with his aſſertion, that it's made a part of the Cannon, a part of the Bible, that God made with him an everlaſting Covenant, So this is the Truth, that I will handle this day, that one may be aſſured, and very clear, they may be able confidently to aſſert, that God has made a Covenant with them, This being a thing of great Importance, I will follow it in this Method. 1. I will open to you, that Aſſurance of a perſonal Intereſt to the Covenant, is very neceſſary. <hi>2ly.</hi> I will ſhew you, that this Aſſurance is not only attainable, but it's not ſo difficult, as ordinarily it's apprehended to be. <hi>3ly.</hi> I will open to you ſome of the Ways and Methods, that the Spirit keeps, in bringing Believers to be Aſſured, that God hath made a Covenant with them. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this Aſſurance, that we particularly are in Covenant with God, is of great neceſſity; that we may be able to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant;</hi> For clearing a little the neceſſity of it, I will premiſe two Diſtinctions, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take notice, that there is a Three-fold Aſſurance, that the Scripture mentions, <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is an <hi>Aſſurance of knowledge,</hi> Coloſe. 2.2. <hi>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full aſſurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt. 2ly.</hi> There is an <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near, with a true heart, in full aſsurance of Faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water. 3ly.</hi> There is an <hi>Aſſurance of hope,</hi> Heb. 6.11. <hi>And we deſire, that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſsurance of hope, unto the end.</hi> v. 12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them, who through faith and patience, inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;</hi> There ye have a Three-fold Aſſurance, there is an Aſſurance, of Knowledge, that is the firſt propoſition of the practical Syllogiſme, by it I come to be aſſured of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Godlineſs, that it's a Truth: There is an Aſſurance of Faith, whereby I am aſſured of my Intereſt in that Myſtery; there is an Aſſurance of Hope, whereby I am aſſured, that God will make out all that is contained in that Myſtery; now we take in all the Three, when we ſpeak of Aſſurance in the Covenant, there muſt be firſt, Aſſurance of Knowledge, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43047:99"/>God hath made a Covenant, and on what Terms he hath made in <hi>2ly.</hi> There is Aſſurance of Faith that I am in that Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> There is Aſſurance of Hope, that all the contents of that Covenant, ſhall in due time be accompliſhed; when I ſay that it's neceſſary a Believer be aſſured, I take in all the Three.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2ly.</hi> Take notice, that there is a twofold neceſſity, when we ſay this aſſurance is neceſſary, that God hath made a Covenant with us. <hi>First,</hi> There is ſomething neceſſary for the being of a Chriſtian. <hi>2ly.</hi> There is ſomewhat neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the well-being of a Chriſtian; now, we ſay not, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that we are in the Covenant, is neceſſar for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Chriſtian, no, one may be in Covenant with God, and far from being aſſured of it; ſeveral times Queſtions about their Intereſt, may be more neceſſar than Aſſurance for them; ſeveral times, the Thief Scandalous, and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſins, will take away their Aſſurance, and ſome times the moth ſlothfulneſs, will take it away; it were a hard Doctrine and dreadful, to ſay, Aſſurance is neceſſary for the being of a Chriſtian, only this Aſſurance we ſay is neceſſary for the well-being of a Chriſtian; they cannot live ſo comfortably in Chriſt, if they were not aſſured that the Covenant is made with them: ſo ye may underſtand what is meaned by this, when we ſay, Aſſurance is neceſſary for the well-being of a Chriſtian, to be aſſured that he is in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>To confirm this, I will offer you five or ſix things, that will let you ſee the Advantages, that the clearneſs of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, draws after it. 1. When our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Covenant is clear, our perſonal Intereſt, it's eaſie to believe all the Promiſes of the Covenant; it's obſerved by ſome Practique Divines, there are two things that makes us doubt of the Promiſes, ſometimes we doubt of Gods power, and ſometimes we doubt of his willingneſs, it's indeed a rare thing to ſee a Chriſtians Faith ſtick at God; power, a <hi>Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſtine</hi> may acknowledge, theſe are the great Gods that divided the Red-ſea; now when we are clear of an intereſt in the Covenant, we can no more doubt of his willingneſs, more than a man will doubt, that his neighbour will give him an Apple, who hath given him the Apple-tree, or that God is willing to give the World light, ſince he hath given them a Sun, and a Moon; no, he is able to believe all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Pardon, of Perſeverance, of through bearing in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43047:99"/>they are all eaſily credited, when we believer, he hath made a Covenant with us, ſince Faith ſticks not at his power, it hath no ground to ſtick at his willingneſs, whenthe whole Covenant is made with us. <hi>2ly.</hi> Another Advantage by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleared of our intereſt in the Covenant, that readily by it we are ſtirred up to love Chriſt, our love to Chriſt takes fire at Chriſt love to us, we can never love him, except he love us: our love to him, is but like a plack candle kindled at a Torch, our love comes to be cleared by his love to us: now there is nothing clears up his love more to us, than to be cleared about our intereſt in the Covenant: an intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant, contributes very much, for the clearing of his love to us: it reveals his love to us, and thereby it kindles our love to him: ſo that beſide, that he eaſily believes the Promiſes, if our intereſt in the Covenant be cleared, we are helped to love Chriſt, and to have our plack candle kindled at the Torch of his love to us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velaed in the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> The clearing an intereſt in the Covenant, is a great remedy againſt ſervile fears, there is a kind of Hell in theſe fears, there is not only a guiltineſs in them, but a torment accompanying them; ye that know what it is to be keepd in bondage under fears, know, that there is no Fever, no Priſon, no diſquieting Diſpenſation outwardly, that can come near the letting in the Waters to the Soul, as a flood of ſervile fears will do; now to be cleared about an intereſt in the covenant, that God hath made it with me, contributes exceedingly to ſcatter all theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fears; there lyes the remedy of theſe fears, the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant, like a Plaiſter laid to a Sore; ſometimes Believers will take other ways to cure their fears, but they bring their Water out of Gutters, and there is no right Balm, that can be applyed to them, but the covenant; ſo if we come to plead an intereſt in the covenant, not only kindles it our love to Chriſt, and ſcatters our fears, But <hi>4ly.</hi> Theſe that have an intereſt in the covenant cleared, are excellently furniſhed for all Duties of active Obedience; whatever God calls a perſon to do, they ſtill go to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, if they be to repent, if they be to pray, if to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if to ſing, or meditat, whatever the Duty be, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to the covenant, is an excellent ſupport; a perſon that will go on in his own ſtrength, in performing Duties, goes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43047:100"/>to bring forth the thing that is not there ben, it's impoſſible to wring it out of thy own heart; So the way to be helped in all duties, is to know an intereſt in the Covenant, <hi>5ly.</hi> Know, there is nothing contributes ſo much to patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to be cleared of an intereſt in the Covenant; it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. When the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is giving the reaſon, why Chriſtians they joy in Tribulation, and are not aſhamed, they are juſtified by Faith, <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God;</hi> Mark there, an intereſt in the Covenant, contributes to their patient ſuffering; it were almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Chriſtian to bear, what we find them put to, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. throughout, if it were not on the account of the Covenant, they hazard on the Faithfulneſs of God, and the credit of his Promiſes, therefore they rejoyce in Tribulation, and waſh their hands in the Flames; and the great thing hath made them do it, is their being cleared, the God hath made a Covenant with them. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> An Intereſt, and to be clear about it, that God hath made the Covenant with us, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar, in regard the neglecting of Aſſurance, is a kind of contempt of the Covenant, the perſon that neglects Aſſurance about it, is a deſpiſer of it; there are ſome things we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue, as if a man let a prine fall out of his ſlieve, he is not anxious that ever he get it again, but if he let a Jewel, or a precious Stone fall, he values that, how careful and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is he, to be cleared, and to get it again? If we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of our Aſſurance, we undervalue the Covenant, we look on it, as a man having a Prin fallen out of his ſlieve; ſo that ye ſee the grounds of a neceſſity of an Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thereby we get love to Chriſt, the faith of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it contributes to ſtop and ſcatter ſervile fears, it's an excellent help to Obedience, and it influences cheer fulneſs under the Croſs; and the neglect of it evidences, that we contemn the Covenant. From all theſe grounds ye ſee, that a Believer ſhould be aſſured, that the Lord hath made a Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I propoſed, That this Aſſurance is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, here we have the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to us, they call us all <hi>Enthuſiasts,</hi> and they ſay, we pretend to a poſſibility of Aſſurance of an Intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; they do not deny, but the Apoſtles and Pen men of the Scriptures, had this Aſſurance, but they ſay, becauſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43047:100"/>
               <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had it, will it therefore follow, that every Chriſtian ſhould have it; no, every Chriſtian ought to have it, and is oblidged to ſtudy it, and that it is attainable, I will make it appear, on theſe Four or Five remarkable grounds. 1. If God hath made it a duty, to endavour Aſſurance of an Intereſt in the Covenant, then it may be attainable, no body will deny this, and that God hath made it a duty, ye will find it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And we deſire, that every one of your do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſsurance of hope unto the end, that ye be not ſlothful, but followers of tem, who through faith and patience, inherit the Promiſes;</hi> Mark here Three things. 1. What the Apoſtle Exhorts to, he Exhorts to Aſurance, and the full Aſſurance of Hope. <hi>2ly.</hi> Whom he Exhorts, it's not the Schoollars only, or the eminent Chriſtians, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>one</hi> of you. <hi>3ly.</hi> It's remarkable, the means he preſcribes, <hi>That ye be not ſlothful,</hi> importing, that ſlothfulneſs will hough their Aſſurances, and that Diligence is the way to attain it; here is a place that evidences, that a Believer may come, not only to Aſſurance, but full Aſſurance, and every one that is Diligent, may come to it. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's evident, that this Aſſurance is attainable, in regard there are ſome Duties called for, that were impracticable, without Aſſurance; as for Example, Chriſt calls a man to this, doſt thou Believe, if the man could have no Aſſurance, nor Knowledge of the Faith, the Queſtion were impertinent, he might Anſwer, It's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for one to be Aſſured, of any Intereſt in Chriſt; he would never have asked the Queſtion, if he could not be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; and Chriſt hath bidden us, <hi>Rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, and rejoyce that you names are written in the Book of Life,</hi> and can we rejoyce in the hope of Glory, or that our Names are written in the Book of Life, if we could not be aſſured of it. 3. That this Aſſurance is attinable, is evident from this, that there is a neceſſary Connexion, betwixt the golden links of that golden Chain of Grace, <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he called, and whom he called, them he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and whom he juſtifice, them he alſo glorifies;</hi> It's not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but we may be aſſured of our effectual calling; they ſay, a man may have Grace, but the knows not if he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere; they ſay he may be in Covenant with God the day, and with the Devil to morrow; no, there is an inſeparable connexion, <hi>Whom he did predeſtinat, them he alſo called, and whom
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43047:101"/>he called, them he juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified;</hi> ſo gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that we may know our effectual calling, and that we are in a ſtate of Grace, we may be aſſured we ſhall be glorified, and our intereſt in the Covenant being once cleared, it can never be diſput again. <hi>4ly.</hi> that this aſſurance is attainable, it's evident from this, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recorded in Scripture had it, and laid down inthe Grave with that, Pſal. 16 9. <hi>My fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope,</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, neither will thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>Thou will ſhew me the path of life. Paul</hi> had it, Rom. 8 38 <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparat me from the love of God, in chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But ſay they, will ye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with them? They had immediat Revelations, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, why are ye not alſo Pen men of the Scriptures? Why writ ye not a new Bible? We anſwer, if the grounds of this Aſſurance had been extraordinar Revelations, we ſhould never have pleaded Aſſurance, becauſe they had it; but the ground of our Aſſurance, is the love of God in Chriſt, and the love of God in Chriſt, is common to all Believers as well as to <hi>Paul,</hi> it's like <hi>the fountain opened in the houſe of David,</hi> that's opened for all the Houſe as well as for <hi>David</hi> himſelf; ſo if they had Aſſurance upon grounds common to all the Elect, all the Elect they may attain this Aſſurance. Theſe things being laid together, will clear this Truth, that as this Aſſurance of a perſonal intereſt in the Covenant is neceſſary, ſo it's attainable,</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to ſhew the Method and way, how the Spirit brings up to this Aſſurance, here ye would mark two things. 1. Take notice, That this Aſſurance of a perſonal Intereſt in the Covenant, is not like the Intereſt it ſelf, but it differs in two things from it. 1. The intereſt it ſelf, it's not acquired by us, it is that which is conferred on us in effectual calling, when we are meerly Patients; the greateſt Intereſt in the Covenant is ſo made up, that in effect, we are meer Patients, when we are intereſted in it; it's not ſo in the Aſſurance of an Intereſt: I deny not, but the Spirit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will give a glance of Light, when one will be very ſlothful, but it's rare; we are to come by our Aſſurance by Diligence: readily ſometimes the Spirit will give extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things; that Myſtery that Mr. <hi>Sibs</hi> reports of a woman
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43047:101"/>in <hi>England,</hi> when ſhe was going to die, all the Miniſters that came to her, as they had often diſcourſes with her, they could bring her to no clearing of her Intereſt, or that ſhe would come to Heaven, ſhe having a Glaſs in her hand, ſhe ſays to them, I can no more be ſaved, than that Glaſs can be preſerved, by throwing it againſt a Wall, and ſhe threw it againſt the Wall, and it did rebound ſafe from the Wall; the caſe of theſe extraordinary things, is like a man coming to a deep water in a dark night, where there are Steps, and providentially one ſhould hold out a Candle to him, and let him ſee over the Steps: if another ſhould come at ſuch a time of the night, he muſt not think, that a Candle will be holden out to him, this is not the ordinary way, we muſt not expect extraordinary things, our aſſurance of an Intereſt, comes in by Diligence, <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> ſo this clearing of an Intereſt comes in by Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and is not like the Intereſt it ſelf, which readily at the beginning is made up, when we are meerly paſſive, and in a ſtate of nature. <hi>2ly.</hi> Ye would notice another difference, that of all things that ever God made, a Believers intereſt in the Covenant is moſt enduring, it ſhall be as laſting, as the Union betwixt the humane nature and the Divine, as long as Chriſt is God-man in one perſon, as long ſhall the Members make up a myſtical Body; if the Intereſt in the Covenant be once ſecured, it's as ſure as the perſonal Union, betwixt the humane and Divine nature; yet there is nothing more unſure, than the Aſſurance of that Intereſt, readily it will be had one day, and doubted the next day.</p>
            <p>And here, before I open the way, how the Spirit brings up one to aſſurance, that the Lord hath made with me a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I would open ſomewhat that hath influence on the changeableneſs of this aſſurance, that we can aſſert at one time, over the belly of all temptations, and at another time, the leaſt thing will make us doubt. 1. Several times a Chriſtian comes to this aſſurance two ways, theſe two ways that Chriſt ſpeaks of, when he is exhorting his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>To lay up treaſures in heaven. where the moth and thief will not come;</hi> ye know there are many utenſils, and things that folk lay up, that are taken away, ſometimes by the moth, and ſometimes by the thief; Divines underſtand by the thief, ſcandalous ſins, if a Chriſtian fall in ſins againſt his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43047:102"/>Conſcience, he will be ſure to have his Aſſurance clouded, he will not be able to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant,</hi> why, the Thief hath taken it away; ſometimes it's not the Thief, but the Moth that takes it away, that is to ſay, ſlothfulneſs, it breaks not in ſo ſtrongly, as the Thief doth, but ſlothfulneſs is like the Moth, that piece and piece frets, and eats away the piece, as the Moth eats the Garment; ſo one may be in Chriſt, and in the Covenant, and it's clear that God hath made a Covenant with them, one day, and another day, the Thief and the Moth, may have taken it away. But <hi>2ly.</hi> This Aſſurance comes to be ſo changeable, that like the Moon it will have many different Forms, the Aſſurance and clearing of an Intereſt, will have many different Forms in one Moneth; God orders it ſo for ſeveral ends, there are ſome perſons, the want of an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Covenant, will damn them, but the wart of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, will not damn them, and yet it may keep them fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doubting; it's very neceſſary, that God take ſome to Glory in a lacking Veſſel, though it drown them not, yet it may weit them, and they may be all their day, under fears and bondage; and this may be neceſſary for them. Having this opened theſe two things, that this Aſſurance is neceſſary, on all the ſix grounds that I have given, that a Chriſtian can never be a comfortable, nor cheerful Chriſtian, except he be able to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> and next that it is attainable, the Lord would never have bidden us rejoyce, if our Names were not written in the Book of Life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he would never have bidden us rejoyce in the hope of Glory, it it were not attainable. So though this aſſurance be variable, and often the Thief and Moth will take it from us; yet it's real, and ſolid, and is attainable.</p>

            <p>IT is a Doctrine, very diſhonourable to God, and very prejudicial to the Saints comfort, to deny, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may be aſſured, that God hath made a Covenant with them; our Divines, in diſputing with <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> on the Heads of the certainty of Salvation, they call that Doctrine, a Doctrine of Devils; they teach the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Devil hath ordinarily taught, for he is often preſſing doubting, and hindring a Chriſtian from ſaying, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant.</hi> Before I ſpeak of the way, how the Spirit brings the Elect to be aſſured; I would yet premiſe ſomethings about it. 1. We do not aſſert an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance <hi>a priore,</hi> as they ſpeak, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that we ſpeak and preach to People, as if we had read the Book of Gods Decrees; and that we there ſaw, who were Elected, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, no, that is not the way we take, we tell them, that the good tree is known by his good fruit, &amp; the corrupt tree is known, by the corrupt fruit, it's not by ſearching into the root, but by ſearching into the fruit, that we tell Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they may be aſſured of their Intereſt in the Covenant. <hi>Next,</hi> We ſay not, that this Aſſurance comes in by <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſms</hi> and Revelations, they ſay, we are <hi>Enthuſiaſticks,</hi> no, we are far from that, we look on their way as deluding; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not the Spirit a liberty, of giving extraordinary things, and the Candle may be holden over the Window, when he is walking alongſt the ſteps in a dark night. <hi>3ly.</hi> When we bid folk be aſſured, by effects and fruits, we do not aſſert an aſſurance by effects, that hath theſe three defects in it. 1. We do not aſſert Marks, as procuring cauſes of an Intereſt in the Covenant, we do not preach, be diligent, and clear an Intereſt in the Covenant; only we ſay, be diligent, and clear an Intereſt procured by Jeſus; Marks are not ſtones of which the Wall is built, but they are excellent Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to make the ſtones ſtick together; the Wall grows little by the Mortar, but the ſtones ſtick together by it; the clearning of an Intereſt, and of what Chriſt hath done with our caſe agree well, when ſuitable Marks are brought. <hi>2ly.</hi> We do not aſſert Marks from Sanctification and Diligence, to wrong the Spirits concurring; the <hi>Antinomians</hi> follow us, they ſay, Marks are prejudicial to the Spirits working; we confeſs, our Marks are all written in ſmall Print, and we have but dark eyes, and if the Sun be not up, it's ill to read
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43047:103"/>them; we deny not, but many Chriſtians are in the dark about their Intereſt, and cannot affirm, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant,</hi> under deſertion; the perſon that would read his Marks under a cloud, is like a man that would read his Charter, when he hath neither Day-light, nor Candle-light. But not to inſiſt on the Doctrine of Aſſurance, againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> I would come to the thing that I left at in the Forenoon; I was proving, that the Aſſurance that <hi>David</hi> aſſerts, <hi>that the Lord hath made with me a Covenant,</hi> is a thing attainable; and I gave you ſeveral grounds of it, and I would add this, that it's not ſo difficult to be attained, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apprehend, I confeſs it is difficult, but not ſo difficult.</p>
            <p>I would offer you for clearing this, that even an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that would exclude ſeveral Fears and Jealouſies, is not ſo difficult to be attained, by offering theſe three or four things to be conſidered. 1. There is nothing it our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, that can prove or evince, that God hath not made a Covenant with us; many a time Believers ſtich at this, <hi>I was a perſecutor, and a blaſphemer,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul, but I obtained mercy, that in me he might ſhew a pattern to them that ſhould come after me,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13.16, Thy former life will not prove, that God hath not made a Covenant with thee, he made a Covenant with <hi>Paul,</hi> and he had as much to ſay againſt him, as againſt thee. <hi>2ly.</hi> The preſent m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xture of corruption with thy Grace, will not prove that God hath not made a Covenant with thee; yea, it may be thou haſt made a Covenant with him, and doubts that he made it with thee; Why? Since thou made the Covenant with him, thou went to him and wrot it down, and ſpread it before him, thou lift up thy hands, and haſt broken it; that will not prove, that he hath not made a Covenant with thee; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had begun very early, the man that wrot this <hi>verſe</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> when he went out againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> he went out in the Name of the Lord his God, his elder Brother was angry with him, and <hi>Saul</hi> called him a Stripling, his Father <hi>Jeſſe</hi> had imployed him to follow the Ewes, the Lord takes him from following the Ewes, and makes a Covenant with him, and when he is a dying, he hath it to ſay with aſſurance, <hi>The Lord hath made a Covenant with me, an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> So that will not prove, that he hath not made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, that ſince thou made it with him, thou
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43047:103"/>haſt failed. Theſe two being laid aſide, they make the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance the leſs difficult. <hi>3ly.</hi> Very ordinarily, this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our aſſurance in the Covenant, comes when there is diligence; ordinarily when we ar ediligent, the Spirit comes and lights his Candle, and lets us ſee our aſſurance; there are a number that complain, they are not aſſured, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their intereſt, and all their Religion lies in doubting; ye may juſtly ſuſpect them that they are ſloathful and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, they are not diligenct, they go not often to duty; were they diligent, they would not want the Spirit's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance: readily if we want aſſurance, we have quenched the Spirit's motions, or grieved the Spirit; were we but more diligent, we would have more Light; all the marks in the world will never clear an Hypocrite, nor give him aſſurance, nor will all the condeſcending marks that God hath made, clear the ſluggard. So, if we were but a little more diligent, we would be more aſſured, and we would be the better able to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant;</hi> for the Spirit uſes not to be wanting with Illumination, to them for whom he gives Aſſiſtance for practical Duties. <hi>4ly.</hi> That it is not ſo difficult, will appear from this Truth; that often the people of God ly in the way fo their own aſſurance, they hinder their own clearing, that God hath made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them.</p>
            <p>I will offer you four ways, how frequently, when clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an aſſurance, about our intereſt in the Covenant, might be had, that we uſe to hinder it. 1. Serveral times we hinder it, by diſputing the Queſtion at a wrong time, we are never ſo ready to diſput our intereſt, as under deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are ſome times when our Spirits will be carried as a Ship under ſall, and all the deſign of the Soul will then be to do, but at another time all the deſign of the Soul will be, to doubt and diſput our intereſt; and we are never more ready to do this, than under deſertion; now, what a fooliſh things is it, to go and debate with a man, that is roving under a Fever, and we are never deſerted, but we are roving; aſſiſting influences are ſo neceſſary then, to go and diſput, to take the time when one is in the dark, and their Candle put out, and then coming to read their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as I ſaid before, our marks are written in ſmall print, and we have but little Light, and if the Candle be put out, then to go, and diſput our caſe, whether God hath made
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43047:104"/>a Covenant with us, in the wrong time; yet readily, we are never more ready to do it, than at that time. <hi>2ly.</hi> Sometime, Believers hinder their own Aſſurance, that God hath made a Covenant with them, not only by chuſing the wrong time, but when they take wrong Marks, they take not the Right Rule; ſeveral times we go exceedingly wrong in our Marks, the generality of prophane and natural men, they take the Marks that the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, <hi>I thank God, I am not like this man,</hi> I am not a drunkard, nor an extortioner; and theſe are their Marks; many a time Believers, they take the contrair way, they take too high Marks, O! ſay they, ſome could ſay, God hath made a Covenant with me, I can delight in him, I can meditat on him, I can be ſatisfied with him as with Marrow and with Fatneſs; But they have the Complaint, that the elder Brother of the Prodigal had, <hi>thou never gave me a kid to make merry with;</hi> I can never count on the day, wherein the Call was killed to me, and that I was cloathed with the beſt Rob, and ſhoes put on my feet, and a Ring on my finger; therefore they conclude, he hath not made an everlaſting Covenant with them, by taking too high Marks; thou may imped thy Aſſurance, I beleive it indeed, which the greateſt Divines affirm the Reaſon, why ſo many at Death have peace, that readily want it all their Lifetime, as ye will find few of the godly, but they will go to the Grave in peace; one reaſon is, at that paſs and ſtrait, they are driven to take the loweſt marks, they can ſay, <hi>All my deſire is before him, and my groaning is not hid from him;</hi> they will take at that paſs the loweſt Marks, for there they muſt either do or die, they are content to do, as <hi>Benhadad's</hi> ſervants did with <hi>Ahab, is he alive, he is my Brother,</hi> they got that word, <hi>my Brother,</hi> they take hold of the leaſt word that makes for them; at that paſs we are driven to take in our light at a ſcore, though it come not in at the window, therefore they have more peace at Death, than they had in they had in their Lifetime, now when we go to take too high Marks, it's a great Impediment in the way of Aſſurance. But I add <hi>3ly,</hi> to let you ſee, that many a time Believers ly in the way of their own Aſſurance, and hinder it, ſeveral times there is an inclination in the Soul, rather to intertain the challenges of the Spirit, than the Comforts of the Spirit, eſpecially after our effectual calling; the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43047:104"/>of the Spirit, will be intertained in a Natural State, far more eaſiy than the challenges of the Spirit. If ye ask what is the Reaſon of this, that after effectual calling, guiltineſs hath another ſmell, then before effectual calling? The Reaſon is, a Believer finds the ſcent of his guiltineſs ſo ſtrong, after effectual calling, that the challenges of the Spirit are far more pronly intertained, than the comforts of the Spirit, the Spirit will ſometime knock at the door, <hi>Open to me, my dove, my undefiled;</hi> but if he come with a knock, and ſay, <hi>thou haſt procured all theſe things, thou hast deſtroyed thy felſ, look back to thy way in the valley,</hi> how will that eaſily be intertained, after effectual calling? Now on theſe accounts, the taking too high Marks, and reading Marks under a cloud, and being ſo prone, rather to intertain the challenges of the Spirit, than the comforts of the Spirit, makes, that a Believer lyes in the way of his own Aſſurance, and cannot come up to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> not becauſe thou wants allowance and ground to do it, but becauſe thou diſputs in the Dark, and takes too high Marks. To cloſe all, I will clear one Queſtion, which readily many of you will ask, and it's the third thing I propoſed, in the Doctrinal part of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the way apd method, by which Chriſtians come up, and can be able to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> how brings the Spirit them to this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I may make way to the Practical part of this Doctrine, I will offer four ſteps, by which the Spirit uſes to bring the Elect, to affirm it as confidently, as <hi>David</hi> ſets it down a part of the Bible, and when he was a Dying; it was not time then to diſſemble, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant:</hi> How doth the Spirit bring the Elect to this ground of Aſſurance, to be able to affirm, that God hath made the Covenant with them? I confeſs, it's great priviledge, and they have a great Charter, that can ſay it's their priviledge, <hi>they have the promiſes of this life, and that which is to come,</hi> they have no leſs in one Article, in one line of the <hi>Bible, He ſhall make them Ruler over all that be hath;</hi> a little time will try this, to be no fancy, but it's furer than the Covenant with the Sun and the Moon, how brings the Spirit them up to this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? 1. Ordinarily before he brings them up to be Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43047:105"/>that the Lord hath made with me a Covenant, he takes down the natural aſſurance like one that hath to build upon an old Foundation, and he finds it rotten, and thinks it beſt to take it down to the bottom, before he build a new Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; ſo that readily, in the beginning of the Spirits working, a perſon can give no account of the Spirits work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither what he hath done in the old Foundation, nor the new; ask you your caſe, you can readily give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet dare not build on the old Foundation, and ye dare not ſay, ye have a new Work; this is very frequenly in the way of the Spirits bringing the Soul to, <hi>The Lord hath made with me a Covenant;</hi> they can neither build on the old ground, nor dare they ſay, they have a new ground; this hath ordinarily a tendency to the clearing of an intereſt, wherever ye find a perſon like <hi>Rebecca,</hi> having Twins ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within her, they know not what to ſay, they are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the Spirit hath taken away the old ground, and for any thing that is known, the Spirit hath not laid the new Foundation; That caſe looks like to be the beginning, to come to that day in the week, that thou wilt ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> That is the firſt Part, whereby the Spirit leads to the clearning an intereſt in a perſonal Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> Where the Spirit is leading, to the clearing an intereſt in a perſonal Covenant with God, ordinarily the Spirit prompts to Duty, and aſſiſts all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; we are not to expect it with raptures of Joy, and Conſolation, and delight in God, many a time like the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian leper,</hi> that was ſent to the King of <hi>Iſrael, I thought he would have come out, and called on his God, and laid his hand on the place:</hi> We think, except we get ſuch elevation of peace and joy in prayer, we can never have peace; no, we muſt not limit the Lord, if he take that way, it's well; but the ordinar way is, he will help at prayer, and excite to delight in him; at another time he withdraws himſelf, and makes the Deſertion thy burden; the complaint of his abſence, may be as ſweet a mark as his preſence; the heart that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his Abſence, may prove an intereſt, as well as his Preſence. Now when he hath pulled down the old rotten Wall, and not poſſibly brought the new above ground, but he aſſiſts in Prayer, in believing, in Repentance, in mortification of luſts, then he is about to bring thee to ſay, <hi>the Lord hath
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43047:105"/>made with me a Covenant,</hi> it's near the break of the day, it's not far from the dawning; he that hath helped thee to Diligence, is not far from bringing thy Conſolation, even tho' it ſeem to be the darkeſt time of the night; yet if the Spirit be helping at Duty, and taking a lift of thy Caſe, the day is near the breaking with thee. But Thirdly, the Spirit guides to this aſſurance, by giving true Marks, that God hath made a Covenant with him. And here I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what are the ſure Marks, by which one may try, if God hath made the Covenant particularly with them; I have made the Covenant with him, and have Vowed and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and Subſcribed with my hand, and have lifted up my hand, but how ſhall I know if he hath made a Covenant with me? The buſineſs is not ſo difficult to know, if thou be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and be not an Hypocrite, and playing the cheat in thy Religion, but conforming thy heart to this Goſpel, and wreſtling with all the Non-Conformities of thy heart; I have ſearched the Judgement of many, how to come to recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Marks, how to know if he hath made a Covenant with us: <hi>Antinomians</hi> have diſput the Queſtion ſo exactly, and Objected ſo ſtrongly, about our wanting theſe Marks, that they put Divines to ſo many Reſtrictions and Limitations that it's difficult to give a reciprocal Mark, on which a Chriſtian may reſt, if he hath made a Covenant with him. I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you three things, on which I lay the greateſt weight my ſelf. 1. That Mark that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath often come over, a habitual preferring of Chriſts Intereſts, to the intereſts of the Fleſh, that is indeed a great Mark that God hath made a Covenant with thee, when Chriſts Intereſts are habitually preferred to all the Intereſts of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>To clear this Mark, ye would notice three things, 1. When God enters in a Covenant with a perſon, they take up Sin as an Enemy, they hate it as an Enemy, they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a League with the contrary Party, they take up Sin, eſpecially preſumptuous ſin as an Enemy, and accordingly they deal with it; they hate it, they eſchew the company that may bring Temptations to it, for they have entered in a League with its greateſt Enemy, even with Chriſt: ſhortly after <hi>Paul</hi> is a Convert, he is at, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death?</hi> He was angry at the very being of ſin, and could not ſuffer the ſmell of it;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43047:106"/>what ever the Sin be, not only preſumptuous and groſs Sins, and neglects of Duty, if thou has entered in a Covenant with God, thou has broken the Covenant with death and hell, and if thou has no kindneſs looking to that Art, thou has great ground to ſay, the Lord has made a Covenant with me, they take up ſin as an Enemy, and deal with it ſo. <hi>2ly.</hi> In reference to this, the Soul goes unitedly againſt it as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the underſtanding is at, I ſhould leave ſuch a Sin, the Conſcience is at, I will leave ſuch a Sin, the Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are at, <hi>Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity, for I have keeped the Commandments of my God;</hi> they turn it out of doors, if there be a taking it up as an Enemy, and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it ſo, and the Underſtanding, Will, Conſcience, and affections, uniting againſt it as an Enemy, thou may be ſure to ſay, the Lord hath made with me a Covenant; the Bargain muſt be driven by both Parties; but if thou be grown ſecure, and neglects Duty, and goes out againſt ſin as a friend, and has not taken it up as a Enemy, and dealt with it ſo, thou may ſay, I have made a Covenant with the Lord, but thou cannot ſay, the Lord hath made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe that have made a perſonal Covenant with him, and he with them, they have a ſecond Mark, they follow the deſign of the Covenant, which is Holineſs, 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Having theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Now, he that hath entered in Covenant with God, and would have a ſure Mark from his Holineſs, ſhould look to theſe two, 1. He is to look to the Holineſs of his heart and converſation; if he ſay, I am holy in my Deſires, and holy in my Delights, I have a holy Joy, and a holy Peace, and has not a holy Walk, and looks not like a ſavourie Chriſtian in his converſation, that perſon cannot readily ſay, the Lord hath made with me a Covenant: he may have made a Covenant with God, but he cannot ſay, God hath made a Covenant with me. Beſides <hi>2ly.</hi> Not only muſt Holineſs be in the converſation, and in the heart, but he is careful to prefer the deſign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to all other things; if the Lord ſhould give thee the Offer that he gave to <hi>Solomon</hi> at <hi>Gibeon, Ask of me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Riches, or Honour,</hi> and many things he named,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43047:106"/>and I will give it to thee, he preferred Wiſdom to them all: So he that is in covenant with God, would prefer Holineſs to any thing that God could offer. It's remarkable, Pſal. 119.111. <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I choſen, as an heretage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Mark how he came by that, <hi>I have choſen,</hi> what chooſed he? <hi>I have choſen thy teſtimonies,</hi> that is a general word, it's no <hi>I have choſen thy Promiſes,</hi> but <hi>I have choſen thy Teſtimonies,</hi> taking in the Commands. Mark <hi>3ly.</hi> For what he chooſed them, <hi>I have choſen thy Teſtimonies for my heretage;</hi> Mark, <hi>4ly.</hi> The reaſon why he chooſed them, <hi>I have choſen thy teſtimonies, for they are the rejoycing of my heart;</hi> importing, whatever I meet with, I get no true joy from it, therefore <hi>I have choſen the teſtimonies, for my heretage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart;</hi> I can get nothing that rejoyces my heart, but allennerly thy Teſtimonies, therefore I have choſen them; that is the ſecond Mark, whereby ye may try, if God hath made the Covenant with you, if ye have come to take up ſin as an Enemy, and deal with it ſo, and if ye have taken Holineſs, not only in heart and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but ye have choſen it as your Heretage, becauſe it rejoyces the heart.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ye may know if he hath made this Covenant with you, by his accompliſhment of the Covenant to you; if he hath begun to fulfil the covenant, he hath certainly made the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you; Experience is a notable ratification of the Promiſe; O but it is a ſweet proof of the truth of the Promiſe. he that believeth hath a witneſs within him, that Chriſt is the Son of God; he hath the Spirit within him, and none can ſend the Spirit, but the Son of God: take a view of the Promiſes, and ſort them, that ye may go to ſuch a Promiſe, when ye are under challenges, under deadneſs and deſertion, and mark them; it's a dreadful thing when all the Bible is alike to us, and when we have not ſome paſſages of the Bible that we may ſay of them, theſe are may Scriptures. Now if he hath been pleaſed to acccompliſh the Promiſe, thou may ſay, he hath made with me a Covenant. It will fall in afterward, when I ſpeak of the ſeveral paſſages in this Verſe, by what Rules we ſhall try, if the things that we meet with in our Spirit, be the accompliſhment of the Promiſe; Obſerve your caſe, and compare it with the Promiſe, many have no skill to do this, they take the Promiſes in Groſſe, they obſerve
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43047:107"/>not abſolute and conditional Promiſes, they compare not their caſe with the Promiſe, therefore none is ſo confident, to ſay, God hath made with me a Covenant. I ſay to you, go home, and ſay to your hearts, the word that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Micajah, How often ſhall I adjure thee, that thou tell me nothing but the truth?</hi> Go and charge your Heart and Conſcience, with <hi>ſee thou tell me nothing but the truth;</hi> if theſe Marks do not agree to thee, whatever thou ſay of making a Covenant with God, thou may go home after all theſe Sermons, and ſay, <hi>I have made a Covenant with God,</hi> but I dety thee to ſay, <hi>God hath made a Covenant with me.</hi>

            <p>WHen firſt I entered on this Verſe, I propoſed four things to be conſidered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Nature of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſecurity, it's a Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Parties Tranſacting in this Covenant, the Lord and me, of theſe two I have ſpoken all the things that I judge neceſſary to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in a multitude of Sermons: The other two Branches of the Verſe, which are the moſt natural, remain to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the firſt whereof are, the Properties of this Covenant, there are three of them mentioned in the Verſe, it's <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> it's <hi>ordered in all things, and ſure;</hi> Where, by the way in the general, ye would notice two things. <hi>First.</hi> That theſe three Properties, are marks of Diſtinction, betwixt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace; it was neither Everlaſting, nor ordered in all things, in any way ſuitable to mans Salvation, nor was it ſure; ſo that from theſe three Properties, we can prove, That the Covenant God made with <hi>David,</hi> it was a Covenant of Grace, and not the old Covenant of Works. <hi>2ly.</hi> Ye would notice, that ſuch as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43047:107"/>would have peace from the Covenant, they muſt ſtudy and be acquaint with the Properties of it, it's no ſufficient ground for <hi>David</hi> at death to ſay, <hi>the Lord hath made with me a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> unleſs it be an everlaſting Covenant, and well ordered, and ſure; theſe who are ignorant of the Properties of the Covenant, can never have the ſweetneſs and conſolation that the Covenant affords. Therefore without further, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and handle this day, the firſt Property that is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of this Covenant, it's <hi>an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> it's true, the main thing I deſign, is, to handle the order of the Bleſſings of the Covenant; and here, before I can come at that I am to handle, there are two textual Doubts neceſſary to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 1. How is the Covenant ſaid to be everlaſting? <hi>2ly.</hi> Whether this be a peculiar Property of the Covenant of Grace, not belonging to the Covenant of Works?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. Firſt.</hi> In what ſenſe the Covenant of Grace is ſaid to be everlaſting?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For opening this, take notice, that a thing is ſaid to be everlaſting in a two-fold ſenſe. 1. That is ſaid to be everlaſting, that is never to end, though it had a beginning; So ye find it, Pſal. 24. <hi>Lift up your heads, ye everlasting doors,</hi> that is meant of the heart and Soul of man, which though it had a beginning, yet it's to endure for ever; ſo Everlaſting, and a proper Eternity, are not one thing, it will take two Everlaſtings to make one Eternity, <hi>from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting thou art God,</hi> mark there, an Eternity takes two Everlaſtings. 2. A thing is ſaid to be Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it hath a proper Eternity; So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.6. Chriſt is called <hi>wonderful, counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace;</hi> now, Everlaſting is to be taken in the ſecond ſenſe, it's an eternal Covenant, not only is it never to end, and is everlaſting, but it's <hi>from everlaſting;</hi> however it was Tranſacted in time with man, yet it was Tranſacted with Chriſt from all Eternity, and it's as antient as the Covenant of Redemption; ſo ye ſee in what ſenſe it's called an everlaſting Covenant, that is an eternal Covenant, from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Whether is this a peculiar Priviledge of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, that it's everlaſting? The reaſon of this Difficulty is. 1. The Covenant of Works is older in Time, for it was made with man in a ſtate of integrity. <hi>2ly</hi> The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43047:108"/>covenant of Works, is firſt in the order of nature, for the covenant of Grace being made with lapſed man, it ſuppoſes the covenant of Works to be broken. <hi>3ly.</hi> It's ſuppoſed by many great Schollars, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not broken the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, he had been everlaſtingly in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and would have continued in pleaſure without death; ſo the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works in the nature of it, was an everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and conſequently, this is no peculiar priviledge of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer to the Queſtion, however the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, was treated with man in time, and though it be in the order of nature, prior to the covenant of Grace, yet in the counſel of God, the covenant of Grace is before the covenant of Works; the reaſon of it is, that which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Doctor <hi>Twiſse</hi> lays, as a Principle; that a rational Agent intends firſt the end, and then the midſes; as a man going to War, intends firſt the end, and then the midſes; the covenant of Grace being the great end, in making the covenant of Works, that by it he might make way for the end, the covenant of Grace; the covenant of Grace is firſt in his purpoſe, in regard it's the great end of the covenant of Works, and he intended the end before the midſes. <hi>2ly.</hi> Whatever the covenant of Works ſhould have been, is a Queſtion of which the Scripture is ſilent: yet the covenant of Works, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not broken it, would have been ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, but being broken, it's laid aſide; ſo that it's far from being everlaſting, in regard of duration, that it's ſuppoſed that man ſtood but few hours, and it was broken, and he was lyable to the Penalty; ſo the covenant of Grace is not only everlaſting, but the only everlaſting Covenant. So having cleared, that this Covenant is everlaſting, I will take only this Note, and handle it this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> That the Covenant with Believers is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant; ſo ye find it frequently called in Scripture, Iſaiah 55.3. <hi>Incline your ear, and come unto me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> So Ezekiel 16.60. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. I will remember my Covenant with thee, in the days of thy youth, and</hi> I <hi>will establiſh unto thee an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> It is frequently called an everlaſting Covenant in Scripture; I ſhall not need to inſiſt to prove, ſo well a known Truth,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43047:108"/>but to take way to the Doctrinal Part, I would Doctrinally enquire into two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In what reſpects the Covenant of Grace is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> I would enquire into the Grounds, why the Lord in his making a Covenant, would not have it a Tack, for a leaſe of years, but an abſolute Gift, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Firſt, in what reſpects it is an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> For clearing of this, I deſire ye may notice theſe two generals. 1. It's an everlaſting Covenant, in regard of Duration, it's from Eternity to Eternity; it's remarkable, Pſal. 103.17. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, upon them that fear him;</hi> it's as antient as God, and will endure as long as God, for all his Decrees and Purpoſes are everlaſting, and eternal, and an Eternity, hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning nor end; this Covenant was treated with the Mediator from all eternity, and will endure with him to all eternity. But <hi>2ly.</hi> Take notice of this in the general, that when God tranſacted the Covenant with man, he intended not to ſet him a Tack or Leaſe, with reſerves, but he intended to make an abſolute irrevocable Gift; therefore it's expreſt in the New Teſtament, not by way of Tack, having a number of Clauſes in it, but by way of Teſtament, <hi>it's the Gift of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> ratified by his death, and none can revock his Will, no, he cannot revock it himſelf; ſo that in effect, it's not a Tack or a Leaſe made of Pardon, or Peace, or a Heaven, in the Covenant, with many reſerves, but it's an abſolute Gift, like the Gift in the Teſtament, that cannot be revocked by any, no by him that made it; which will appear if ye notice three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Take notice, that when God tranſacted the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant himſelf, and his Son, he in a manner, bound up his own hands, from ever revocking the Gifts contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; if once he give them, then he cannot revock them, Pſal. 89. <hi>If his children forſake my Law, and walk not in my judgements, if they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then will</hi> I <hi>viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes: nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will</hi> I <hi>not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail, my covenant will</hi> I <hi>not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips;</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:43047:109"/>Mark there, he binds up his own hands, he hath made the Gift ſo abſolute, that though he be provocked, he will not break; it's not like a Tack, made betwixt a Lands-lord and a Tennent, that if the Lands lord be forefaulted, the Tack will fall; he hath paſt from all theſe Articles and Clauſes, and bound up his own hands, that if my children offend, I will correct them with the rod of men, but my Covenant I will not break. <hi>2ly.</hi> I deny not, but there are conditions in the Covenant, but the man that gets the Gift, cannot fall in the condition, the Covenant cannot fail on that ſcore. Why? As the conditions required, ſo it is alſo promiſed; God hath not left it to the freedom of mans will, to repent or not to repent, to believe or not to believe, but he hath ſecured it in the Covenant, as a Maſter ſetting a Tack to a Tennent, ſhould bind him to ſuch a Farm, and in the mean time, obliged himſelf to give him as much as to pay him; if there be a faily there, it muſt be on God's part, and not on theirs. <hi>3ly.</hi> For ſecuring the condition, take notice, that there are in the Covenant clauſes of Pardon, nay, not only ſo, but on ſuppoſition that a Believer ſhould fail in the condition, his failing makes not the Covenant to be altered, the Covenant remains firm; no change in the Elect, can alter the Covenant; indeed, a change in God would do it, which were impoſſible, but though we believe not, yet be abides faithful: and here comes the Covenant to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, to be everlaſting, that there are Promiſes of the condition, and there is more, there is pardon of failings in the condition; the caſe is, as in a Marriage-covenant every failing looſes not the Marriage, it may have an influence on an interruption, on the Marriage-fellowſhip, but not on the Marriage knot; the caſe is ſo in this Covenant, it's almoſt impoſſible for a Believer, to fail in the condition, except God fail in his Promiſe, which is altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and though there were a failie in the conditions yet it breaks not the Covenant, it ſtands firm, notwithſtanding of their unbelief, this is no <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrine, but it's ſolid, and well grounded upon Proteſtant Principles againſt <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe two Generals, I will offer four things, that will evidence the Covenant to be everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> It's everlaſting, in regard of the Foundation, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43047:109"/>ground on which it ſtands, there are three principle grounds, on which the Covenant ſtands. 1. It's founded on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God's Election, his eternal purpoſe of glorifying the Elect, whom he hath choſen; ſo that it is collateral with the Election, and there can never be a change in that, except he alter his Decree firſt, and then the Covenant; if once he take a perſon in Covenant, before he caſt him out of the Covenant again, he muſt of an Elect, make him a Reprobat. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Covenant is founded on his love, <hi>with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love have I loved thee, therefore wich loving kindneſs will I draw thee. 3ly.</hi> The covenant of Grace is founded upon the Covenant of Redemption, the Father hath Tranſacted with the Son from all eternity, and that cannot be altered then, and far leſs now, after the Son hath performed all his part of the Tranſaction, what he had engaged to in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, it could never be altered, and far leſs now after the death and Paſſion of Chriſt, and conſequently, the Covenant of Grace and Redemption, muſt ſtand and fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo it cannot chuſe but be an everlaſting Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's an everlaſting Covenant, in regard it's one and the ſame, without the leaſt change in all ages, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end, there is not one Article of it at all altered, ſince the day it was publiſhed in <hi>Paradice</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor will be altered, till the laſt man that will be born in the World; there is nothing more reeling, than the caſe of a Believer, ſometimes they are left under Challenges for guiltineſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are abhorring themſelves in duſt and aſhes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have peace, and ſometimes they have terrour; there is nothing more reeling, than Providences are; God is ſometimes ſmiling, ſometimes correcting, but in the midſt of all theſe reelings, the Covenant remains the ſame; there is not the leaſt jot or ſyllable of it, that comes to be altered; as it was publiſhed in <hi>Adams</hi> days, when he publiſhed it in the <hi>Garden,</hi> it's continued until now and will continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the laſt man that ſhall be born upon the Earth; and whatever reelings be in Providence, the Covenant is always the ſame; even as it is with the Sun, ſince the day it was made, it is ſtill the ſame, there hath been many Winter and Summer days, many Showres and Blinks, yet the Sun hath not loſed one hour of its Courſe, in its riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it did at the beginning; nor is it an hair breadth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43047:110"/>diminiſhed of its light, for all the light he hath given, nor is he weary with running his courſe, but he comes forth in the morning as a Bridegroom, and as a ſtrong man that rejoyces to run a race: So the Covenant, amidſt all the Providences, and diverſities of changes, it's ſtill the ſame, and will be ſo, until the laſt man that ſhall be born upon the earth. <hi>3ly.</hi> It's called everlaſting, in regard all the fundamental privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Covenant, are everlaſting; effectual calling being once gotten, it remains; the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance; there is the pardon of ſin in the Covenant, and that once being had, can never again be called in queſtion, Jer. 31.34. <hi>I will forgive their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and I will remember their ſin no more, I will blot out their iniquities for my names ſake;</hi> Mark there, <hi>I will blot out their iniquities,</hi> and if once they be blotted out, <hi>I will remember them no more;</hi> if I once pardon Debt, I will not again remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; therefore he is ſaid, <hi>to caſt our iniquities in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſea, and I will caſt them behind my back, and I will bury their ſins;</hi> Importing as much, as if once one get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, it's everlaſting, and it's that which he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver revock, nor keep up a quarrel for the ſin he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Nay more, the Covenant becomes everlaſting, in that it remains even in death, the Covenant remains with our duſt in the Grave; it's very remarkable, when Chriſt tells his Diſciples of <hi>Lazarus</hi> death, he tells them, <hi>our friend Lazarus ſleeps,</hi> he ſays not, he that was our friend, but he that <hi>is our friend;</hi> the Covenant remains with our duſt in the Grave; all the tyes among men, they are looſed by death; the Woman is freed from the Law of her Husband, and they remain no longer Husband and Wife; the Relation betwixt Husband and Wife, betwixt Parents and Children, and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they are all made for time, and time lays them in the Grave; it is not ſo in this everlaſting Covenant, it remains even in death, and never parts with us, until it poſſeſs us in an everlaſting Crown; ſo all the fundamental priviledges are everlaſting, it's everlaſting union, it's everlaſting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and everlaſting peace, and the Covenant is never ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, until it poſſeſs us in a Crown. <hi>4ly</hi> It's everlaſting, in regard the Parties covenanting are everlaſting, not only hath this holden true, conſidering the principal Parties, the Father and Chriſt, but even Believers and their Seed,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43047:110"/>they are both everlaſting, and every particular Member that is taken in Covenant, is an everlaſting Party in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; it may be, ſome of them, thirty years, or thirty two years, will open their Grave, and they muſt ly down in it, but even there, they ceaſe not to be Parties in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: it's remarkable, Mat. 22. I <hi>am the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living;</hi> from which he proves the Reſurrection, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that place is, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are living, or elſe the Covenant could not be everlaſting, <hi>Abraham</hi> is living in regard of his Soul, his Body is living in regard of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at the great day, for the Covenant is made with his Duſt; however it were hard to find his Duſt, yet he is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a living Party in the Covenant, yea, even his Fleſh is an everlaſting Party in the Covenant, although it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into Duſt, and the Fowls and wild Beaſts carry it away, yet ſays <hi>Job, with theſe eyes, and no other for me, ſhall</hi> I <hi>ſee God.</hi> This proves the Party to be everlaſting, every Believer is an everlaſting Party in the Covenant; ſo that taking either the Grounds on which the Covenant ſtands, the Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and Love, and the covenant of Redemption; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the conſtantneſs of the Covenant, amidſt all the changes of Providence, and the caſe of Believers, like the Sun, that is the ſame Winter and Summer, or conſidering the fundamental priviledges of the Covenant, all of wich are everlaſting; it's everlaſting Election on which it's founded, and everlaſting Calling, everlaſting Pardon, and an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven; but the Parties are alſo everlaſting. not only in regard of their Head, but <hi>Abraham</hi> is a Party in the Covenant, and God is his God, which is the Sum of the covenant after <hi>Abrahams</hi> duſt can ſcarce be found in the Grave.</p>
            <p>I will ſpeak a word to the ſecond thing that I propoſed, the grounds why the Lord would have this covenant, to be an everlaſting covenant. (1.) In the contrivement and drawing up of the covenant of Grace, the Lord deſigns the exaltation of his Grace, and that was to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace, as the Apoſtle words it in the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> now if there be never ſo great things promiſed, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I <hi>will take away the heart of ſtone, and give you an heart of fleſh;</hi> but had the eaſe been the next day, that he had ſaid, I will take away the heart of fleſh, and give you
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43047:111"/>an heart of ſtone, what would that have ſignified for the exalting of his grace? Had he been one day giving an heart of fleſh, and another day taken it away, wherein would his Grace have been exalted by ſinners, unleſs it had been by, I will give you an heart of fleſh, and I will never take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your effectual calling? Had there been no more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe Grace, but the changeableneſs of it, it had been enough; therefore God would have his Covenant everlaſting. and herein he would have a diſtinction betwixt the Covenant that was made of Grace, and that which ſtood on the free will of man; the principal ground on which the Covenant of Works tood; was Free will, and in that ſtate he had Free Grace, yet it depended on his Will; but herein is Grace exalted, in that he cannot alter his Covenant, no, therein lyes the exaltation of Grace, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Covenant ſtanding on the Free will of man, though perfect, and the Covenant founded on Grace and Chriſt, that the one is everlaſting, and the other endured but for a few hours; ſo that it is to the praiſe and glory of his Grace, and the exalting it above all his other Attributes, that he hath made this Covenant an everlaſting Covenant; it's not that he is payed for it on theſe Terms, it's not from merit, nor purchaſe, that he hath fulfilled this Covenant, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the praiſe of the glory of his grace in Chriſt Jeſus, that the Covenant is made ſo everlaſting, that though God (to ſpeak with reverence) and man encline to alter it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not after it. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> The Lord made it thus everlaſting, that Believers might have ſtrong conſolation; it's remarkable, the allowance of joy in the Covnenant, it's full joy, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that your joy may be fuil;</hi> they are bidden <hi>rejoyce evermore,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce always,</hi> and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we be bidden rejoyce, when there is full joy allowed in the Covenant; nay, there is not only conſolation, but <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6.18. <hi>God hath confirmed it by two immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, that they might have strong conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to the hope ſet before us;</hi> and the truth is, it's a Principle of <hi>Arminians,</hi> they tell, a Believer may have Grace to day, and they may have the Devil to morrow; they may be effectually called to day, and a Child of the Devil to morrew; it houghs all conſolation, if they were in never ſo ſweet a temper to day,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43047:111"/>they cannot tell but they may be a Child of the Devil to morrow, and what peace and comfort would there be, if the Covenant were not everlaſting? So when we have ſearched all the grounds, why God would have this Covenant ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, they are ſummed up in this, in exalting the Grace of his Son, and affording ſtrong conſolation to them that have taken themſelves to the Covenant. So ye ſee the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is everlaſting, not by way of Tack for ſo many years, but it is an abſolute Gift, and the Father hath not only, not put in reſerves into it, but he hath abſolutely bound up his hand, and confirmed it by two immutable things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is impoſſible for him to alter, which is his Oath, and the blood of his Son; ſo that now it ſtands on ſuch Terms, as (to ſpeak with reverence of the Majeſty of God) it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to alter it.</p>

            <p>IT is a ſweet Obſervation, that ſome have made on that word <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> as it's applyed to the Covenant, taking everlaſting for a proper Eternity; it's a peculiar Attribute of God, agreeable neither to Angels nor Men, and yet God hath given this Attribute to the Covenant, it's an eternal Covenant; God puts in a Letter of his own Name in <hi>Abrahams</hi> name, He puts in the Letter <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he was firſt called <hi>Abram,</hi> and then puts in this Letter, and calls him <hi>Abraham,</hi> He puts in a Letter of his own Name <hi>Elohi,</hi> in <hi>Jacobs</hi> name he was firſt called <hi>Jacob,</hi> and then he calls him <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but in the Covenant, He puts in one of his own eſſential Attributes, and that is <hi>Eternal;</hi> and this could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſaid of Angels, nor of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>Jacob,</hi> it could be ſaid of none of them, that they were Eternal, but the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43047:112"/>Covenant is an eternal covenant, it's from everlaſting to everlaſting, and this hath a conſiderable weight into it. I followed in what reſpects the covenant was everlaſting, and why God would have it everlaſting, He intended to exalt his Grace, and give ſtrong conſolation to his Elect. I will now follow the practical improvement of it, in two Uſes, and in clearing of three Queſtions, which I conceive, will abridge the things neceſſar, in this Property of the covenant, that it is everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is it an everlaſting covenant, it ſerves for Inſtruction, in theſe ſix or ſeven particulars. 1. Then there is a great Myſtery in the Covenant, of all things that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Philoſophers write of, it's the moſt difficult thing, to take up Eternity, they write many things about Eternity, that they cannot explain, as when thye write of the nature of it, they ſay, that it is <hi>tota ſimul &amp; perfecta poſſeſſic,</hi> they ſay it is a duration, and <hi>altogether a duration,</hi> and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive of that; they ſay, it's without beginning, and we cannot comprchend a thing that is without beginning, let our imaginations run back millions of millions, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it; when one falls upon the thoughts of Eternity, he is like a man wading a deep water, he that is fardeſt in, it ſooneſt over the head, and herein Scholars are drowned, the reaſon is, a finit thing cannot comprehend an infinit, more nor a Cockle-ſhell can comprehend the Sea; ſo, that which is Eternal, is a myſtery, and the Covenant is Eternal, and conſequently is a myſtery; it's an eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, it began in Eternity, and will continue unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo then it's a great deep, take not only the Truths of it, God and Man in one Perſon, a Virgin, and yet bearing a Son, and many ſuch things; or take the practice of it: I many times have pitied Ranters, but I have not thought it ſtrange, that they take the greateſt Myſteries of the Covenant, for fancies; a Believer may try, where natural mens Diabolick conjectures lyes, for the Covenant is a great Myſtery, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> and no wonder, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men ſtand and demur, and at length rant, and reſolve to hazard on the things that are ſeen, and caſt at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for it's a great Myſtery. <hi>2ly.</hi> If the Covenant be everlaſting and eternal, it informs us, who was the Author and Contriver of it, and of whom we hold all the privileges
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43047:112"/>of it; it was very remarkable, when the Diſciples asked Chriſt, if they ſhould pay tribute to <hi>Ceſar?</hi> Says Chriſt, <hi>ſhew me a penny, whoſe image and ſuperſcription is this,</hi> ſays he? They ſay, <hi>Ceſars, give unto Ceſar the things that be Ceſars, and to Chriſt the things that be Chriſts:</hi> So that Eternity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of our Image, any thing the property whereof is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, hath no part of our Image or ſuperſcription, for we are but of yeſterday, and we know not what will be to morrow; and any thing that is eternal, we have no influence on it; and if the Covenant be properly Eternal, as evident it is, then all the Glory of contriving, and Ordering, and the pureneſs of it, we have no influence on them, for we are but Thieves, If either we ſteal or reſet any thing that is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, we came but yeſterday out of our mothers womb, and to morrow we muſt return to the Duſt, and be laid in the Grave. <hi>3ly.</hi> It informs us, if the Covenant be eternal and Everlaſting, that as we were not the Authors of it, ſo we were not the procurers of it, for it was before we had a beeing, it was when we were nothing, and there is none of us will queſtion, but in Eternity we were nothing, and when we were nothing, what could we contribute, or merit, or put chaſe from God? For all the tenor of the Covenant, if it be everlaſting, ſpeaks out love in God, and Grace in God, but it cannot ſpeak out any thing in us, except we could procure ſomething, when we were nothing; now we are to be informed of it, if it be everlaſting, it's a Myſtery, it hath not our Image and Superſcription, we were not the Authors of it, and we did nothing to procure it, unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe, that we could merit, when we were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>4ly.</hi> If the Covenant be everlaſting, it informs of the great Obligation, that we have to the Mediator of the Covenant; the truth is, we might have had a quarred with him, he acting in our room, though he had drawn it in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo excellent terms, if he had not made it ſicker, we would have thought him like a Work-man, that ſet the Nail in a right place, but did not roove it, and make it ſicker, excellently is the Covenant drawn, but if he had forgotten to roove the Nail, and make it ſicker, that if we repent, we ſhall be pardoned; if we believe, we ſhould be ſaved? Theſe are eaſie terms, but if it were ſo drawn, that we were in a ſtate of Grace the day, and out of it to morrow, we ſhould
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43047:113"/>be pardoned the day, and might be damned to morrow, we might have had ſome quarrel againſt him, that ſtood in our room, that the Covenant, though it were free and gracious, yet it were not ſicker and rooved; but ſo excellently was it rooved and ordered, that among the reſt of the properties of it, it's everlaſting. There is a very great obligation to the Mediator, that when he had modelled, and ordered the Covenant, with the greateſt freedom and fulneſs of Grace, he rooved the nail, and made the Covenant, ont theſe Terms everlaſting; when he had obtained of his Father, all the Terms of the Covenant, he would have in that in it, that it's everlaſting, and that theſe Terms ſhould never be altered again. <hi>5ly.</hi> It informs us, on what grounds the perſeverance of the Saints ſtands; we ſay, it's not our skill to guide Grace, we ſay not that it's from the nature of Grace, but we build it eſpecially upon the perpetuity of the Covenant, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is an everlaſting Covenant, the Mediator hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this Covenant, that if once we be in Covenant, we can never be out of it; and he hath rooved the nail ſo, that Satan can never draw it, with all his Hammers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that he can bring, thereon ſtands the perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Saints; that is the thing that can never fail them, if once they be married, they are ever married, and if once they be in Covenant, they are always in Covenant, for it's an everlaſting Covenant; But add <hi>6ly.</hi> If the Covenant be thus everlaſting, ſee from it, the difference betwixt the mercies of the Covenant of Grace, and the mercies of the Covenant of nature; I confeſs there are ſome things in the Covenant of nature, that they may ſay of them that there is ſuch a Covenant properly, the Ordinances of the Sun and Moon, the Rain falling on the juſt and the unjuſt, the ſhining of the Sun and Moon perſevere; but theſe natural things, how changeable are they? We have health to day, and may be ſick to morrow; there are few, but in a little ye will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know their faces to be what they were: there is a moth in their body, and a thief in their ſtrenght: many time our humours are like our beauties, we loſe the things we love; we find our Relations diſſolve, the Friends we hd are dead, the Enemies we had, and the things of time, like a Wheel, are conſtantly reeling and turning about; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a few months produces another face than it
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43047:113"/>had: but it's not ſo with theſe mercies of <hi>David</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venant, they are everlaſting, it's not ſo with our Election our effectual calling, our union with Chriſt; it's not ſo with any fundamental priviledge of the Covenant; ye that are conſtantly complaining, and finding the reelings of the World, learn like a Child that is weaned from the Pape, it's not that the Mother intends to hunger the Child, but that ſhe would have it feeding on ſtronger Meat; the reaſon why ſo many are complaining of the bitterneſs of the things of time, and the changes of them, their health, their ſtrength, and their friends, are not what they were; it's not that ye ſhould want them, but we would have you ſeek them in the Covenant, and the ſure mercies of <hi>David;</hi> there is a conſiderable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt them, and the things of Time, for who ever builds on the things of Time, they are drawing their waters out of the Gutters, and not out of the Spring, but theſe are founded on an everlaſting Covenant. <hi>7ly.</hi> If the Covenant be everlaſting, then it informs us of the Wiſdom and Skill of the guide of them, that make choice of the Covenant; there is hardly Wiſdom in the choice of other things, they will not laſt, variable and changeable Humours, and variable and changeable Things, that every day fade; they are no <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,</hi> that take them to the Covenant, the mercies of the Covenant are great mercies; for though they were ſmall, yet they are everlaſting, and better long little, than ſoon nothing; and there is nothing in Time everlaſting, but like a Waſter, they ſoon ſpend and waſte; thy heart, thy ſenſe, thy Fleſh will fail thee, thy Reaſon will turn to Melancholly, and thy young Ones will look on thee, as one that hath ſcarce the exerciſe of Reaſon; all theſe things will reel to and fro in the World, and we muſt expect that it will be ſo; but this everlaſting Covenant is as the Sun, it will ay riſe at its appointed hours, and go to at them, and there will be no ſtop of its Courſe, its not <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> to go on the ſureſt Grounds, that ever men followed, that take them to this Covenant, and reſolve to hang both their ill and their good on it, that is the firſt uſe of the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe of the Point is this Covenant, an everlaſting Covenant, then Chriſtian, labour to improve it as an everlaſting Covenant; make uſe of this Property of the Covenant, that it is everlaſting. And there I will offer you
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43047:114"/>five Caſes, that truly take in the moſt part of the exerciſe of Believers, all of which come to have ſome anſwer, in this Property of the Covenant, that it's everlaſting. 1. It comes to be an ordinar caſe, and the improvement of the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs of the Covenant, it is a good anſwer to it, I ſay, it comes to be an ordinar caſe, I am guilty, I cannot feed on the Covenant, for I know the thing of my ſelf, that no other knows; this Property of the Covenant, takes aways this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, if God had made this Covenant ſo, as he made the Covenant of Works, <hi>in the day thou eats, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> this Covenant is broken, but the Mediator contrived it to be everlaſthing, which would never have been everlaſting, if ay when we were guilty, the Covenant ſhould be altered; no, under all the challenges that thou has, if ever thou was in Covenant, and hath the Marks that were given the laſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day, of God's making the Covenant with thee, there thou muſt continue in the Covenant, or thou muſt ſcrape out of the Covenant, everlaſting Covenant; no, this Property of the Covenant, when I come to the laſt <hi>verſe,</hi> and there ſhew you, how you ſhall anſwer your Challenges, ye will hear that guiltineſs does not caſt out of the Covenant, for if that were, it were not everlaſting, <hi>2ly.</hi> There is a ſecond caſe, wherein it is to be improven, and it is very frequent, I am a poor croſſed Body, and ſcarce have Bread, and either I am not in the Covenant, or he hath broken it. But I ſay alſo, that this is anſwered in this, that it's everlaſting; I like a word of Maſter <hi>Dickſons,</hi> he ſays, it's ordinar for perſons that treat with God in the Covenant, they conform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to their caſe, but they will not conform their caſe to the Covenant; ſuppoſe there ſhould be never ſo many croſſes in thy caſe, yet thou art to rule thy caſe by the Covenant, and not to bring the Covenant to thy caſe; it's ordinar for thee, to tell thy neighbour, either I am not in Covenant with him, or elſe it's broken betwixt God and me; but ſuppoſe thou ſhould go to thy bed ſupperleſs, and the next morrow have a greater croſs, and knows not what to get to thy Breakfaſt, thou art to bring thy caſe to the Covenant, but bring not the Covenant to thy caſe. <hi>Abraham</hi> when he is to offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> on mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> in a burnt sacrifice, no body that would have met him, but they would have ſaid, God hath broken the Covenant with him, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43047:114"/>Earther be bleſſed; Abraham</hi> knew well, that out of the aſhes of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God would fullfil his Promiſe, he reduces the aſhes of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to the Covenant, reduce ay thy caſe to the Covenant, but bring not the Covenant to thy caſe. <hi>3ly.</hi> There may be another great improvement of it, and it's this, I am frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenged and deſerted, it's not poverty and ſickneſs that I complain of, but of challenges and deſertions, and I am undoubtedly out of Covenant, it is not everlaſting to me, for I am challenged and deſerted. The Husband may go from home, and bide long away, and come home angry, but that looſes not the marriage ty, the marriage union remains; neither does his abſence, nor his quarrels, prove the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be looſed, the Covenant, the marriage Oath remains firm; it's a ſore matter, that when we come under any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, we can never underſtand where we are, until our exerciſe comes to fundamental doubtings; it's a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, my Husband is long away, and he is come home, but without a challenge to me, but it's a fore matter to come home with, he hath declared himſelf not to be my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he hath put me out of Doors, and he will give me no allurement, but he calls me a Whore. So that under all theſe variety of Diſpenſations, this property of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs of the Covenant, may be well improven; I am guilty, if thou take that, as putting thee out off the Covenant, thou may put out that word, everlaſting Covenant out of the Bible; ſome are croſſed and deſerted, but the perpetuity and everlaſtingneſs of the Covenant, runs like the Sun, and keeps its courſe in a direct line, in Winter as well as in Summer. <hi>4ly.</hi> Some are troubled with this, what ever my caſe be, I think I will not perſevers; but thou art miſtaken, thou knows not the Tenor of the Covenant, it's everlaſting, all thy Experiences, and all the Elevations of Spirit thou haſt had, and all the things thou haſt had, that thou thinks looks like blinks with Jeſus; there is no wedding, but thou may be an Aduterer, or an Idolater, but the Covenant ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures all; it's true, the fundamental priviledgs ſecures thee as to them, but it ſecures thee not from very groſs ſins, but that which ſecures all, is founded on the Decrees of God, and the Covenant of Redemption, it's impoſſible for him to lie, and to be unfaithful, and to deny himſelf, therefore the Covenant ſtands ſirm, if thou be at, I know not what to do,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43047:115"/>if Tryal or Popery come, I will deny him; but if thou be in Covenant, the Covenant is everlaſting, and not only the Devil and his Angels, cannot caſt thee out of Covenant, but to ſpeak it with reverence, God hath made it everlaſting and unalterable for Himſelf. 5. There is a fifth Difficulty that many ly under, ſome may ſay, I am near Death, I find my ſelf hanging over the Grave, I find theſe Legs, and this Back, and this Head, things that will not long ſubſiſt, I muſt go to the place, where there is no mention of the Covenant, no ſpeaking of his loving kindneſs: but thou art miſtaken, it's not like the Covenant betwixt Husband and Wife, if the one of them die, they may take another; the caſe not ſo, if the Worms ſhould deſtroy this Body, and the Birds ſhould fly away with a bit of thy Body, that is left above the Ground, the Covenant is with that bit, it's the Fathers pleaſure, that I ſhould loſe nothing, that I ſhould not loſe a Nail of a Toe, for the Covenant remains with thy duſt, for it is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant; I think our ignorance of the Covenant, is the great ground of the moſt part of our trouble, if we underſtood it, and the Properties of it, we might have a more hopeful, and cheerful life, in our walking with Jeſus, than we have. I would here clear two or three Queſtions, and but name them. 1. Readily ſome may ſay, this day is very ſweet to hear, that Chriſt hath rooved the nail ſo, as it cannot be drawn again, if once we be in Covenant, we will never be out of it again, and the Father hath bound up his own hands as it were, that it's impoſſible for him to do otherwiſe, therefore ſome may obejct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion</hi> 1. Can this Covenant be everlaſting, for of all the changeable Providences that ever we ſaw, perſons that are in Covenant meets with, they are croſſed, challenged, deſerted, and rejoycing one day, and in the duſt the next day, ye will ſcarcely find them in one Frame?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I like the Obſervation well, that a certain Divine hath, on the eighty ninth <hi>Pſalm, If his Children forſake my Law, then I will viſit their ſins with rods, but my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, my Covenant will I not break; I have ſworn that I will not lie unto David, his ſeed ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me, it ſhall be eſtabliſhed as the Moon for ever;</hi> why are theſe two put in, the Sun and the Moon? Ye ſhall never obſerve a change of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43047:115"/>the Sun, it's any alike great, but the Moon <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> write of it, will have fourteen or fifteen ſeveral Forms, in one Month; it hath every night almoſt a new Form, and they give names to every ſeveral Form; but the meaning is this, it's as much as the Covenant that I ſware to <hi>David,</hi> ſhall be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable a thing as the Sun, and yet ſhall be as changeable at the Moon, that returns ay when it's full Moon, it ſhall be changeable and unchangeable; theſe that come in Covenant with him, may ſay, as to all Fundamental Priviledges, it is as the Sun, and as to the things built on theſe Foundations, it's as the Moon, as to the variety of caſes, it will be as the Moon, that will have twelve ſeveral Forms in one Month, and yet be unchangeable as the Sun; and ye muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ye are not in Covenant, and that it's no everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your peace, joy, liberty in Duties, and Covenant clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be as the Moon, and your Covenant caſe may be as the Sun. <hi>2ly.</hi> All the changes that falls out in thy Lot in time, that are like the Moon, they at length terminat in theſe Fundamental Priviledges; it's remarkable, that for all the changes that the Moon hath, once in a Month it's full Moon, it's true, it will not bide long at that; they that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, all their changes, long at length terminat in their Fundamental Priviledges, which is a remarkable thing, their peace, their joy, is not Fundamental, yet it ſhall be as the Moon, all the Alterations in the Covenant, they are at length Terminat in the Foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Secondly, it may be Objected againſt this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingeſs of the Covenant, is not this a Doctrine, tending to ſecurity and prophanity, to ſay, one is in Covenant, and never out of it, doth not this lay a God to Secruity, do we not ſing folks aſleep, that readily comes to produce old experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and are now taken and carried away with <hi>Scotlands</hi> back-ſlidings, and to tell them, it's an everlaſting Covenant, and it's impoſſible to alter, lays not this a God to Security?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I will cloſe all this comfortable Truth, by telling you theſe three things. 1. The Secure and Prophane, it's almoſt, and more nor ſuſpicious, they are not in Covenant; if one be Secure and Prophane, they may do as I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times told you in preaching, like a man coming by an Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and he claughts a Branch of the Apple-tree, and lays it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43047:116"/>up in his Coffer, and thinks that he will have Apples of it, but it wants the Root, and it will neither have Leaves nor Apples; ſome ſay, that they have gotten a Promiſe, I am afraid, that they have but a riven Branch from the Root; if ye be fallen Secure, prophane, and negligent, and yet are telling your neighbours, I have gotten a Promiſe long ſince, ye have gotten a Branch, and that ye have claught off the Root, and it's without the Root, and will neither bear Flouriſhes nor Apples. 2. This Doctrine tends not to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, nor prophanity, in regard all that are in this Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, they receive Influences, that keeps them from ſecurity and prophanity; I will not ſay, but they may have their Winters, <hi>David</hi> had it for a year, it was a year after he went in to <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and murthered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> before the Prophet comes to him. The Spouſe is made to ſing, <hi>The winter is over and paſt, the Summer is come, the time of the ſpringing of herbs is come;</hi> the Spring muſt come if thou be in Covenant with him, therefore it opens no door for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or Prophanity, for they that are in Covenant with him, it's impoſſible for them to continue in Security, I <hi>will put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me. 3ly.</hi> This Doctrine hath no tendency to Security, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, theſe that are in Covenant, if they will not be awakened by the Word, the Lord will awaken them by the Rod; I have told you, that Chriſt hath three Poſts, he ſends after Believers, there is his Word, and his Rod, and if none of theſe two will prevail, he will ſend his Spirit, and that will prevail; they that are in Covenant, cannot get leave to live in Security and Prophanity; if the Word will not waken them, the Rod ſhall do it; and if neither of theſe two do it, the Spirit ſhall do it; ſo, if any ſhall ſay, I am ſecure, and am living in Security, thou may go and daſh thy head againſt a ſtone, but this Covenant is Everlaſting, and it cannot be altered, we ſhall be judged by it, in the day of our appearing.</p>

            <p>IN the right up-taking of the Covenant, we muſt not only ſearch into the Nature of it, but into the Properties of it, three whereof are expreſſed in this <hi>verſe,</hi> it's <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> it's <hi>ordered in all things,</hi> and it's <hi>ſure.</hi> The firſt of theſe I ſpoke to the laſt day, that it was Everlaſting, and have ſhewed you many things about it, Doctrinally and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically.</p>
            <p>I come to the ſecond Property, <hi>Ordered in all things,</hi> this, though ye do not at firſt ſee through it, yet ye may ſee it afterward; having a great deal of Marrow into it, and it's a very material Property of the Covenant; the Word in the <hi>Hebrew Vehalma, Mentanus</hi> renders it, <hi>diſpoſitum in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus. Junius</hi> renders it, <hi>ordinatum in omnibus.</hi> The <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gints,</hi> or the ſeventy Interpreters, Tranſlate it by a Word borrowed from a General Marſhal in an Army, putting all his Forces in a Military Order; <hi>it's well ordered, as a well Marſhalled Army,</hi> wherein every one is in their proper po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and ſo is the Covenant ordered, the meaning is, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the Covenant, is fitly diſpoſed, or appointed, or ordered. And for clearing of it, ye muſt take notice, that the intention of the Spirit of God, in ſpeaking by <hi>David</hi> that it's fitly ordered, is not only to ſhew, that there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent method, and ſorting of all the parts of the Covenant, but that it is excellently ſorted and ordered, in order to the great end, for which the Covenant was made, to advance the Glory of God, and the Salvation of the Elect, which are the two great ends, for which it's made, and herein it differs from the Covenant of Works, for though it's not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but it be well ordered, and fitted, yet it neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43047:117"/>ſo much, nor was it ſo conducible, to exalt God, and bring the Elect to Glory, as the Covenant of Grace is; which I might let you ſee in many particulars, it was well ordered in a way ſuitable to that Diſpenſation, but not in all things, in a way tending to exalt God, and the ſalvation of the Elect, as the Covenant of Grace is; to be brief, this is a very ſpecial property of the Covenant of Grace, and a diſtinguiſhing one from the Covenant of Works, that it's ordered in all things, not abſtractly, but in order, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the end, which is to exalt God, and to promote the ſalvation of the Elect. So this property of the Covenant is conſiderable, as it's an everlaſting Covenant, ſo it's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhelled, and Ordered, and diſpoſed as an Army, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent poſture for a Victory. This being the meaning of it, I will make two Obſervations, and follow them in ſeveral following Sermons; the firſt of them I will but name, but ſhall God willing, dwell on the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, that ſuch as would have conſolation from the Covenant, muſt obſerve the order and method, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the contents of the Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> I will take this, that the Covenant is excellently and ſingularly ordered, in all things relating to the exalting of the Father, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and the ſalvation of the Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine</hi> firſt, <hi>Such as would have peace, as</hi> David <hi>had at his death from the Covenant, are to conſider the order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> ſo doth <hi>David</hi> here, when he is rejoycing, among his laſt acts, from the Covenant that God had made with him; he conſidered it as a Covenant ordered in all things, theſe that take not up the right order of the Covenant, and the method of it, can never have ſweetneſs, nor peace, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from the Covenant.</p>
            <p>For confirming and clearing this to you, I deſire ye may take notice of theſe three things. 1. God who is the God of Order, and not of confuſion, (for ſo the Scripture calls Him) he is very exact in obſerving of Order; Obſerve him in natural Things, in the Work of Creation, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Order he keeped, firſt to make Light, then to make other things, and then bring in Man when all things were Ordered for him: There is an excellent Order in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, the Ordinance of the Sun and Moon, and all the Stars have an Order, by a Decree appointed them; it's true,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43047:117"/>there will appear confuſion in his Providences, but they are but like the black and white Threeds in a Web, or like the diſcordant Strings of an Inſtrument of Muſick, they all move to make the Inſtrument play, or like the Wheels of a Knock, though ſome of them move againſt other, yet they all tend to make the Knock ſtrike when the hour comes; ſo all his Providences, tend to the end he hath Decreed; he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Order in his Church, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in Order;</hi> they that are for confuſion, are not for God, for God he is the God of Order, and not of confuſion; it's true, <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Prelats</hi> would build on this, a multitude of humane Inventions; but Order is beſt keeped in the Church, when it's according to the Scriptures, God is the God of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Parity among Church-officers hath no tendency to confuſion; for Chriſt would never have eſtabliſhed a Parity among his Apoſtles, if he had thought it confuſion: To be brief, God is the God of Order, and both in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, and of the Church, he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Order, and hath ſaid, <hi>Mark them that walk diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and they who are overturners of Scriptural Order, they become enemies to the God of Order, who hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Church, to be like a <hi>Babel,</hi> or a maſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; but He hath appointed Order, and all things to be done decently in it. <hi>2ly.</hi> Take notice of this, that eſpecially he hath appointed an Order in the Covenant; to make no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Covenant, and obſerve none, is to make Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin; take for Inſtance, there are ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Covenant, <hi>I will blot out your iniquities, though they were as ſcarlet, I will make them white as wool, they ſhall be forgotten, and ſhall be no more remembered; and I will caſt them behind my back,</hi> and ſuch like; now, if one ſhould take theſe Promiſes, and not obſerve the order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they make Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin; there cannot be a greater afront put upon him, than to think that he hath done any thing to encourage Sin, no honeſt man will take it well, to ſay to him, thou art an encourager of the wicked; take ſome Promiſes of the Covenant, and let him go to them, and ſay, I have gotten a Promiſe, but they obſerve not the Order of the Covenant; <hi>Shall we ſin, that grace may abound,</hi> ſays <hi>Paul? God forbid.</hi> Now he that will take a promiſe of pardon, and feed on it, and rely on it, and not
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43047:118"/>obſerve the Order of the Covenant, he makes Chriſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Sin, and Grace the occaſion and encourager of it. <hi>3ly.</hi> There can be no true peace, except ye obſerve the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant, in regard the Spirit, who is the Author of peace, makes it according to the method of the Covenant; it's true, Sathan and our own hearts, will influence a kind of peace, but ordinarily they violat the Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, their peace comes not in according to the method of the covenant; when the Spirit gives peace, he is the Spirit of Promiſe; when he comes and comforts, <hi>He ſhall take of mine,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſhew it you,</hi> that is, he ſhall take of my Peace, and my Righteouſneſs, and give it to you; the Spirit in influencing Peace, keeps the Order of the Covenant; where ever there is peace, and the Order of the Covenant not keeped, it is ſuſpected to be either a Peace of our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or a Peace that the ſtrong man that keeps the Houſe gives; for when the ſtrong man keeps the Houſe, all is at peace; therefore, there can be no true peace from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, except we obſerve the Order of the Covenant, which the Spirit of Promiſe keeps; ſo this is an unqueſtion able Truth, Chriſt would be the Miniſter of Sin, and Grace would be the occaſion of Sin, and there would be no true peace, and God would not be the God of Order, but of confuſion, except we obſerve the Order of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. I would apply this a little for two Uſes, and ſo go forward. The firſt Uſe is, to reprove them that lay claim to peace from the Covenant, but obſerve not the Order of the Covenant; I have gotten a Promiſe that he will blot out my iniquity, and what needs me to fear? But that Peace is not from the Spirit, when it comes not in according to the Order of the Covenant; take a ſingle Promiſe, and no more in the Covenant, and thou ſhall make God the God of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and not of Order, and Chriſt the Miniſter of ſin, and the Spirit to ſpeak peace, not according to the Order of the Covenant; who ever they be, that will build on a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſe, and not obſerve the Order of the Covenant, can have no ſure Peace from it; who are they then, that will plead the Covenant, and not obſerve the Order of the Covenant?</p>
            <p>I will evidence this to you in five or ſix particulars. 1. When one pleads a Promiſe in the Covenant, and hath no
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43047:118"/>good, nor well grounded Intereſt in the Covenant, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Order of the Covenant; the Covenant muſt firſt be ours, and then we may plead the Promiſes of it; we come to plead the Farm of a Field that is not ours, and that we have not payed for; when we plead the Promiſes in the Covenant, and hath no Intereſt in the Mediator of the Covenant, we plead the Juncture, when we have not married the man; before we can have a right to the Apple, we muſt have a right to the Apple-tree. I will be thy God, before I give thee peace, or give thee pardon. This is the great ſubſtance and marrow of the Covenant, they that cannot ſay that God is their God, and yet will take a promiſe of pardon, and of peace, they over-turn the Order of the Covenant; readily many come and plead the Promiſes, and God may meet them with, <hi>what haſt thou to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth?</hi> Is the Covenant thine? Is the Mediator thine? Thou but breaks thy Neighbours Orchard, to go and take a Promiſe, and not in the Order of the Covenant; thou but ſteals it, and runs away with it, like a man that will break his Neighbours Orchard, and take away the Apples that grows on his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Tree; the Mediator is not thine, the Tree where the Apples grow is not thine, thou may take promiſes, but thou over-turns the Order of the Covenant, if thou take a Promiſe, and not marry the Promiſe-maker. <hi>3ly.</hi> They over-turn the Order of the Covenant, who plead the Promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but they forget the Commands of it; the Covenant is made up of Promiſes and Commands; the Commands are indeed fewer, they are indeed not ſo exactly preſt, as in the Covenant of Works; now he that will plead a Promiſe, and go to it as his own, and tell his Neighbour, I have gotten a Promiſe, and in the mean time ſlights the Command, he overturns the Order of the Covenant; if ever peace come in by a Promiſe, it muſt come in by a way ſuiting the Order of the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> They over-turn the Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that plead the conditional promiſes of the Covenant, and have never preſt the abſolute Promiſes; the conditional promiſes, are promiſes of peace, and joy, and pardon, and communion with God indeed; but as ye ſhall hear, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſes, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give thee a heart of fleſh,</hi> muſt be accompliſhed before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of pardon; the Lord hath promiſed pardon, but he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43047:119"/>hath promiſed it only to the penitent; he that prays for pardon, and hath not repented, he tempts God, and God muſt overturn the Order of the Covenant, if he give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before Repentance; the abſolute Promiſes muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before the conditional: and he that will ſay, I have gotten peace, and pardon, or fellowſhip and communion with God, and yet hath never been effectually called, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew what Faith and Repentance was, or the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a heart of ſtone, and giving a heart of fleſh was; what ever Promiſes he talk of, he hath overturned the Order of the Covenant, the firſt and abſolute Promiſes, muſt be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before the conditional: So who ever ſays, give me peace, pardon, and communion the day in the Church, and yet hath never had the accompliſhment of the abſolute Promiſes, he tempts God to overturn the Order of the Covenant. <hi>4ly.</hi> They overturn the Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that would plead ſome Promiſes of the Covenant, and neglect others; the Order of the Covenant is, to whom one Promiſe is fulfilled, all Promiſes, though not in the ſame degree, are alſo to be fulfilled; there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral will plead, Lord, forgive me my ſin, give me pardon, but the promiſes of Sanctification, the promiſes of Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Holineſs, in the Life and Converſation, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of cleanſing, they plead not theſe: They that go ordinarly to Chriſt for Juſtification, and forget Him for Wiſdom and Sanctification, they indeed ſeek the Promiſes, but they would have him overturn the Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Lord is peremptory, in keeping the Order of the Covenant, and he will not break it; for if he brake it, he would overturn the whole contrivance of Grace; which we do when we plead the Promiſes, and forget the Commands. <hi>5ly.</hi> They overturn the Order of the Covenant, who, though they mind the Duties of the Covenant, yet they mind not all the commanded Duties in the Covenant; there is ſome Idol they would ſpare, that readily the Covenant binds him moſt againſt; it's true, when we enter in a perſonal Covenant with God, we bind againſt every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but eſpecially our Idols; yet it's ſtrange, that the thing that we incline eſpecially to ſpare, is that which we are moſt bound to wreſtle againſt; if it be Pride, Carnality, Earthly-mindedneſs, Senſuality, Laſciviouſneſs, that which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43047:119"/>in a perſonal Covenant, we are moſt bound to wreſtle againſt, is the thing we are moſt prone to ſpare, and he that does ſo, overturns the Order of the Covenant; the thing that thou does, when thou art entered in a perſonal Covenant with God, if thou ſpare thy Idols, if God ſpare thee, he will overturn the Order of the Covenant. <hi>6ly,</hi> and laſtly. They overturn the Order of the Covenant, who would have in the beginning, and when they lay the foundation of a Work, the thing that God hath promiſed them, at the putting on of the Cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: I have known ſeveral precious to God, that have concluded a work of Effectual Calling not to be real; Why? Say they, I have not that peace, and that joy in Believing, that I ought to have; but thou may believe twenty years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou have joy in Believing. There is peace in Believing, but not in the firſt laying of the Foundation of the Work, nor is there joy in Believing, ay when we would be at it; no, we overturn the Order of the Covenant, if we do this; and the Truth is, as ye ſhall hear, the great reaſon why we have ſo little ſweetneſs from the Covenant, we obſerve not the Order and Method of the Covenant, we might have a great deal of ſweetneſs from the Promiſes that we want, and we might draw out of theſe Breaſts of Conſolation, refreſhing Milk, if we knew the Order of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. I will cloſe this Obſervation, with ſaying three things about it. 1. I exhort thee to get an Intereſt in the Covenant, and then to plead it; Marry the man, and then plead the Contract. I propheſie to you all that are not effectually called, and all that are not united to Chriſt in the Covenant, all that I have ſaid, or that I am to ſay from the Covenant, or all that ye can plead from it, ſhall never be to your advantage; there are great and precious Promiſes in the Covenant, <hi>I will blot out your iniquities, and remember them no more, I will caſt them behind my back, and caſt them in the bottom of the Sea;</hi> none of them all are to you, if ye nave not married the Man. 2. Conſider, if ye would follow the Covenant orderly, conſider ſeriouſly, what a ridiculous thing it were, if a Sinner ſhould go to that Promiſe, <hi>though your iniquities were red like crimſon, I will make them like wool, though they were as ſcarlet, I will make them white as ſnow:</hi> If ye ſhould not obſerve the Order of the Covenant, and not obſerve what is required
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43047:120"/>before ye get that fin pardoned; might not all Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Adulterers, and Murderers, and Blaſphemers, and Sabbath-breakers, come and ſay, O here is a Promiſe, I will blot out your Iniquities, and will remember them no more, and ſprinkle clean water upon you, if they ſhould not obſerve the Order of the Covenant; and by the way, take good heed, how ye bring in a promiſe, if ye keep not the Order of the promiſe, ye have no right to the promiſe. <hi>Antinomians</hi> tell us, we may preach to Sinners reeking in ſin, and bid them believe, immediatly after the act of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sin, and tell them, though your Iniquities were as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow, they obſerve not the Order of the Covenant. 3. I would have you in Order to this, that ye may obſerve the Order of the Covenant, know, how the Covenant is ordered, what is the Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in which God hath caſten the Covenant, ſince we can never get Benefit from the Covenant, except we obſerve the Order of it? If we plead one Promiſe, and forget as neceſſary an one, if we plead pardon, and have not repented, if we plead peace, and are not effectually called; it's true, there are promiſes of peace and pardon, but they are not pleaded according to the Order of the Covenant, and this leads me to the ſecond Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That in order to the Glory of God, and the Peace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Believers, God hath appointed an Order in the Covenant to be obſerved, and we muſt obſerve it.</hi> He hath appointed an Order, and an excellent Method in it, for it proceeds from the God of Order, and it's treated by the Mediator of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the right Order of the Covenant, is one of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Encouragements that Believers have; and I will let you ſee, that of all the Ingredients in the Covenant affording Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Order of the Covenant is one of the ſweeteſt.</p>
            <p>To break then in upon it, there are two things I muſt premiſe, and ſhall only name to make way to the reſt. 1. Take notice, that a Covenant may be ſaid to be Ordered two ways. 1. When all the parts of it are rightly Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Ordered. 2. When all the parts of it, are rightly Ordered and Diſpoſed, with a reference to the end; the firſt is called an Abſtract Order, the ſecond a Relative Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; in handling this Order of the Covenant, I will firſt conſider the Order of it Abſtractly, and let you ſee, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43047:120"/>all the Promiſes are rightly Ordered; Secondly, that all the Commands are rightly Ordered. 2. I will conſider it with a reference to the End; There are two great Ends in the Covenant, the Exalting of Chriſt, and the bringing the Elect to Glory; and here I will let you ſee, that both the Promiſes and Commands, are excellently Ordered, in reference to Chriſts Honour, and Believers peace, and their Heaven. 2. I intend to let you ſee, of what Importance it is, for a Chriſtian in his way to Glory, to obſerve the Order of the Covenant; for it's a deep contrivance of Grace, there cannot be a greater Deluſion, for a perſon to ſay, I have gotten peace and pardon, and neither the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of peace nor pardon hath come in according to the Order of the Covenant; if it hath come in not according to this Order, it's but a peace that Satan or thy own heart hath given thee.</p>

            <p>AMong other Meditations that <hi>David</hi> had, when he was a dying, concerning the Covenant, he remembred the Order of it; had it been a Covenant that had not been everlaſting and ſure, or had he fed on it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving the Order of it, it would not have afforded peace; but among other things, he put in this, <hi>Ordered in all things and ſure,</hi> the Lord hath made a Covenant with me, ordered in all things and ſure. I propoſed two Obſervations from this, Firſt, that ſuch as would have peace and ſweetneſs from the Covenant, they muſt obſerve the Order of it, take a ſingle part of the Covenant, without its Harmony and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it might have been a God to Security, but it could not afford peace. I entered upon the ſecond Obſervation, that God had appointed an excellent Order in the Covenant, I
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43047:121"/>will not Criticiſe on the various deſcriptions of Order, what it is: we have many Diſputs with the Patrons of Ceremonies, that ſay, that we have no Order, about, the Definition of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſome define it bo be a convenient placing of means and midſes, that relate unto an end one after another; but I will not inſiſt in enquiring into the nature of it. I propoſed to enquire, Firſt, into the abſolute Order of the Covenant; Secondly, into the relative Order; the Order of it in reference to the two great Ends. in exalting of Chriſt, and the ſaving of the Elect. In the abſolute Order, I propoſed, 1. To ſpeak of the Order of the Promiſes, and then of the Order of the Commands. 1. To the Order of the Promiſes, a Truth very neceſſar to be obſerved, by all thoſe who have the Promiſes for their Charter, and that have all their Hope founded in them: many have written long Diſcourſes of the Order of the Promiſes, which now I will not dwell on. I ſhall reduce all that I ſhall ſay, that is neceſſary for you to obſerve in your Practice, in reference to the Order of the Promiſes, to theſe three Heads. 1. I would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the Order of the Matter of the Promiſe. 2. The Order obſerved in the timeing of this Matter. 3. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obſerved in the Diſpenſing of the Promiſe; the Spirit of God hath appointed an excellent Order in the Promiſes, in reference to all theſe three, and Chriſtians would obſerve this Order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is an Order obſerved in the matter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, 1. There are ſome Promiſes abſolute, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; God hath made ſome Promiſes, if we were never ſo wicked, if never ſo drowned in nature, if never ſo carnal and ſold under ſin, yet the Promiſes take us in: there are other promiſes he hath made, that we muſt be Gracious, Believers, Mourners, before we can hope for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them; it could not be expected in reaſon, I will take away the heart of ſtone, providing the he have it not; but he could ſay, I will give you a heart of fleſh, if ye have it not: So there are ſome promiſes abſolute, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, they but tempt God, if they go to him with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſe, and want the Condition; but they may go to Him with an abſolute Promiſe, a Truth very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar to be obſerved, we may go to him in prayer for pardon, for peace and communion, and preſs him with his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43047:121"/>peremptorly, while in the mean time, he might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Order of his Covenant, if he grant it; that he cannot do, for the Covenant is the reſult of his eternal Decree, and it's ordered by Chriſt, and is infinitly for our advantge, and for thee and me, to overturn that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, were great preſumption, we may go to him and ſay, Lord, give me Repentance, give me Faith, and take away the heart of ſtone, for they are abſolutely promiſed; but we cannot go to him for peace, pardon and communion, and glory, ſo peremptorly, except we have the condition: So the order is neceſſary to be obſerved, ſome are abſolute, and we may abſolutely plead them, and ſome are Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and may only be pleaded when have the condition, which is neceſſary to be obſerved; when ſome complains, Lord, I have no joy, and comes away wanting it, no thou art a fool, thou has not gotten pardon. and how can thou have peace and joy. 2. Another thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the matter of it, there are ſome things he hath promiſed preſently, and ſome things are only promiſed for the future; there are ſeveral things promiſed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and will be as the dew for influences of holineſs,</hi> but the perfection of holineſs, is only promiſed for the future. So if we go to God and preſs him with perfect Mortification, pertect Love, perfect Holineſs that is in the Covenant but it's not promiſed now. but it is to be expected afterward; ſo if we obſerve the method of the Covenant, we muſt obſerve, what is to be given now, and what is to be given in Heaven; for the one, we muſt exerciſe Faith, and for the other, we muſt exerciſe Hope. So if you ſhall go and preſs him with the promiſe of perfect delight, perfect peace, perfect joy, if he give thee the hope of it, he anſwers thy prayer, for the promiſes of the Covenant bears, the one to be perfected now, and the other to be perfected hereafter. (3.) In the matter of the promiſe obſerve, there are ſome things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed abſolutely, and there are ſome things promiſed, but there is a reſerve in Gods heart; as for example, there is Adoption, Effectual Calling, Sanctification, if thou be a Believer, there is pardon and a Heaven; there are alſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things promiſed, ſuch as health, deliverance in trouble; now in the matter of the Promiſe, God is a Supream Lord,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43047:122"/>he hath reſerved a latitude to himſelf, that he will either give health or ſickneſs, he will either give deliverance, or not give deliverance, what ſignifies the Promiſe then? Yes, very much, for he doeth not prove untrue to his promiſe, even in temporal things, but better than his promiſe, if a man ſhould promiſe to his neigbour an hundred weight of Lead, if he give him an hundred weight of Gold, ye would not ſay, that that man had broken his promiſe, but was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his promiſe; if he give a ſanctified improvement of the promiſe, the promiſe is not broken, but the Promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> maker is better than his promiſe; So we may go to him, and peremptorly ſay, Lord take away this ill heart, and if he taken it away, we may ſay, Lord, give me pardon, give me peace, joy, and aſſurance; but we cannot ſay, Lord, give me health and proſperity; the reaſon is, in the order of the Covenant, there is a liberty of exchange left to the Lord in temporal things, that he may give the thing, or a better thing; but he hath not left a liberty of exchange in ſpiritual and eternal things: for to ſpeak with reverence, he would not be true to his promiſe then; if one would come and ſay, Lord, give me peace, if he anſwer not, but give him health, he would not be ſo good as his promiſe. (4.) In the order of the matter of the promiſe, take notice, there are ſome things promiſed, that God hath promiſed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but he hath not promiſed to give with theſe things, the diſcovery of them; he may give the thing, and he may hide it when it is given; he may be true to his promiſe, and accompliſh the thing promiſed, and yet the perſon be like the man that ſought his Hat, when it was on his Head; it is one thing, to give the thing promiſed, and another thing to give the diſcovery of it; there may be ſome ſaying, <hi>fails his word evermore? hath he forgotten to be gracious?</hi> but our eyes may be darkned, and we cannot ſee the accompliſhment of the promiſe; ſome may ſay, O! he hath not made out his promiſe to me, for I have not that peace, that joy, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, theſe influences, that he promiſed; but thou may have theſe, and the promiſes may be accompliſhed, and thou not ſee them So in the order of the promiſes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the matter of them, we are to take notice of all theſe four. (5.) Take notice, that the promiſes in the matter of them, are ſo ordered, that like work-men about
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43047:122"/>one work, one of them works to anothers hand, one promiſe makes way for the accompliſhment of another; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the promiſe of influences, <hi>I will be as dew to Iſrael,</hi> makes way for that promiſe, <hi>and he ſhall grow as the Lillie, and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon,</hi> Hoſ. 14.5. Every one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, eſpecially the ſirſt promiſes, makes way for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; ſo, if God give repentance, the perſon may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue, that he will get pardon; if he give faith, he will certainly get communion with Jeſus; if he take away the heart of ſtone, he will ſprinkle them with clean water; if he call them, he will certainly juſtifie them; and if he juſtifie them, he will glorifie them; for whom he calls, them he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, and whom he juſtifies, them he alſo glorifies.</p>
            <p>But 2. Another thing to be remarked, in reference to the order of the promiſes, and that is the order of the timing of them; O but he was wife that drew this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and had excellent ſkill of ordering all the Articles of it: There are four things remarkable, in the order of the timing of the promiſes of the Covenant. 1. There are ſome promiſes Divines call Legal promiſes, there are other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they call Evangelick promiſes; the Legal promiſes go before the Evangelick, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. When the Spirit ſhall come, he convinces firſt of ſin, that is a Legal work, and then he convinces of righteouſneſs, that is an Evangelick work; this order of the Covenant of promiſes, relating to a Law-work, they go before the promiſes, relating to a Goſpel-work; in the ordinary way of his working, he kills, that he may make alive, he hath torn, that he may heal, heſmites, that he may bind up, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. Theſe who are obſerving the order of the Covenant, and the promiſes of it, muſt expect them in this method, that the Spirit ſhall firſt convince of ſin, and then of righteouſneſs; ſome are convinced of righteouſneſs, and they talkk of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, before they be convinced of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, before they be convinced of ſin, but they are overturning the order of the Covenant. 2. There is this remarkable in the order, of the timing of the promiſes, the promiſes that relate to a gracious frame; a perſon can never come to be in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame, before he be in a gracious eſtate, no, that is impoſſible, a natural man, and one that never had a Law-work, can never come to a gracious frame; an hypocrite
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43047:123"/>may have flaſhes, and things that may put on the clothes of a gracious frame, but in the order of the covenant, we muſt firſt be in a gracious eſtate, before we be in a gracious frame; all the Communion-days, and all the rods that a natural man comes under, and all the expreſſions of love to Chriſt that he hath, makes not up a ſpiritual frame; Why? he is not in a ſpiritual ſtate, and the order of the Covenant muſt be overturned, if this be. 3. The Lord hath this in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the timing of the proiſes, that there are ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he will begin early to accompliſh to a Chriſtian, and readily will keep them under theſe promiſes, the moſt part of their life; whereas it will not be theſe promiſes that he will keep other Chriſtians under; as for example, there are ſome promiſes of conviction of challenges, of diſcovering of iniquity, he may bring one under theſe promiſes, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually call them, and all their life-time keep them under them; whereas many have theſe promiſes accompliſhed, and lives but ſhort while under them; the reaſons are, in the order of the Covenant, God hath reſerved a liberty to himſelf, the Mediator hath promiſed to make out all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the Elect, but he hath reſerved a liberty, he will keep one feeding on one promiſe all their life, and will change them to others, the reaſon is, he reſerves a liberty to himſelf, in diſpenſing all the promiſes; ſo one may be brought in early, and changed and effectually called, and all their life-time may be kept under the drop of Conviction, whereas others boy I he may let out with a Pin, and bring thee eaſily to the promiſes of conſolation; why? In the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant, though he hath ſecured the main to every Elect, yet the order fo the promiſe is, that he ſhould have a latitude in it, as Lord, which is not looſed by the obligation of the Covenant. 4. There is this order to be obſerved, in reference to the timing of them, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the firſt graces, which are fundamental and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, they are made out to the Elect, ſometime at the third hour, ſometime at the ſixth, and ſometime at the ninth, and ſometime at the eleventh, it's near twelve then, but he hath reſerved this liberty in the order of the Covenant, that though thou be an Elect, and ſhall have all the fundamental priviledges, and all the priviledges built on the foundation, yet ſome may have them at the third hour,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43047:123"/>ſome at the ſixth, ſome at the ninth, and ſome gets them not until the eleventh; ſo, he hath ordered the Covenant, in reference to the timing of the promiſes ſo excellently, that yet he remains a Lord, the Marriage-tye that makes him an Huſband, deprives him not of being a Lord, and of time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the particulars, in reference to believers.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, Conſider the Covenant in the manner of diſpenſing the Promſes, and the order is remarkable in this, and here ye would notice theſe things. 1. In Gods diſpenſing the Covenant, there is this order in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, that the mercies beſtowed, are all firſt given to Chriſt, and through him they come to be ours; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pardon, his Peace, and Communion with him, <hi>we come to be bleſt with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places, through Christ;</hi> the Father has contrived the Covenant ſo, as they come to us, all through Chriſt, and it is the more excellent order, that the ſmell of his purchaſe, and his interceſſion is on them; ſome move a Queſtion, What is the reaſon that Chriſt ſhould be an Interceſſor, and ſhould pray for the thing that he bought, and payed for? They tell, that the Father in the contrivement of the Covenant, he would firſt have his Jeſtice ſatisfied, which is ſatisfied by his purchaſe: And ſecondly, he would have his grace glorified, which is by the interceſſion of a Supplicant, now when any thing comes the Covenant-way to a Believer, through Chriſt it comes, ſo as the price is conſidered that he gave for it, and that's a fruit of Gods Juſtice, and then the interceſſion is conſidered, ſo that there are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Mercies, but it ſmells of the Fathers Juſtice, and of his Mercy, and of the Sons Purchare and Interceſſion; ye never get an Act of Communion, nor an anſwer I Prayer, but it hath the ſtamp on it, both of Chriſts Purchaſe and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. 2. In the diſpenſing of the promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there is this order in the manner of diſpenſing them, that God diſpenſes them to Believers according to their capacity; readily he doeth with them, as with the Corn, or the tender Plants, if he ſhould open the Windows of Heaven, and let out Rain as a Deluge, it would drown all the Corn and the tender Plants; but he makes drops fall here and there, and now and then, that the Corn and the tender Plants may ſpring up and grow; the promiſes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43047:124"/>are ordered ſo, as they are full, but we have no Veſſels to contain the Oyl: It's remarkable, there are two great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the New Teſtament, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul; Peter</hi> is brought up to mount <hi>Tabor; Paul;</hi> is caught up to the third Heaven; the Lord hath recorded theſe inſtances, to ſee how we would carry, if we had an Heaven upon Earth; <hi>Paul</hi> ſees Chriſt transfigured, and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> with him, and how carries he? <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us build here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for</hi> Moſes, <hi>and one for</hi> Elias; the Text ſays, <hi>he wiſt not what he ſaid; Paul</hi> he is raviſhed up to the third Heaven, and he knows not whether in the body, or out of the body, he heard things unutterable, and what follows, <hi>a meſsenger of Satan was ſent, leſt I ſhould be puft up with abundance of revelation.</hi> The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant is ſo contrived, as the bleſlings of it, they ſhall not come one as a full deluge, as they did upon <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> that deſcended on Mount <hi>Hermon.</hi> 3. In the matter of diſpenſing the promiſes of the Covenant, he hath wiſely provided it ſo, that the Covenant-bleſſings ſhall be rather ſuited to our neceſſity, than to our appetite; there are two things that the Father conſiders in the bleſſings of the Covenant, and they are, our need, and our appetite; as a Phyſician that hath a Patient in a Fever, but he is roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he conſiders neither what is beſt for his need, nor for his appetite; had we been at the contrivement of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we would have put in nothing but peace, pardon, and proſperity; theſe are nothing but roavings of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a Fever; but he hath put in among the promiſes, the croſs, nay, the correcting with the rods of men; why hath he put in this? Though it agree not to our appetite, yet it agrees to our neceſſity; ſometimes a deſertion, and ſometimes a proſperous condition, may be wholſome for us; therefore he hath appointed all the bleſſings of the Covenant to come through Chriſt, ſo he hath ordered them in a way, rather ſuiting our neceſſity than our appetite; which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved, when we lay our hands or our loyns, and we tell, there is a Covenant of ſuch promiſes, and I have neither peace nor joy, thou may have the thing that ſuits thy need, and be refuſed of the thing that ſuits thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: ſo, if ye conſider all theſe, ye ſhall find the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are all well ordered, they are much better ordered that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43047:124"/>we would have carved them out, if we had been at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving of them; if we had been tryſted with abundance of revelations, we would have been puft up; if we had been on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> we would have roaved; ſo, the Covenant is far better ordered, than if it had conſiſted of eminent rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of love, and tranſcendent raviſhings of joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But here is a difficulty, may ſome ſay, are there not many contraries in the Covenant, as for example, find we not mercy and juſtice in it? find we not Chriſt killed? find we not many Law-works and Evangelick? find we not plentiful promiſes, and dark providences? and can that be a well ordered Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To conſirm that the Covenant is well ordered, I would have you notice two or three diſtinctions, that are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved by a Believer, and to be eyed in this deep of the ordering of the Covenant. 1. Diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the beginning of Chriſts accompliſhing a promiſe, and the end of it, ye would not think the beginning a piece of the ſame Web with laſt, ordinarily when he begins to accompliſh a promiſe, ye would think it a threatning, there is hardly any that looks on it, but they would think it like <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going to Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> with his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with Wood and Fire to offer him up in a Sacrifice, ye would think that he were to accompliſh a threatning, but wait un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end, and ye will ſee it otherways: the Gold-ſmith before he dreſs a Watch, he will take it all down, and then dreſs it; this is very neceſſary to be diſtinguiſhed, for often at the beginning of the accompliſhment of a promiſe, we are at, I am undone, and at the end, we are at, I had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, if I had wanted it; what ever contrariety appearin he providence, in diſpenſing promiſes, yet it's but the half of his work, ſtay until the end, and ye ſhall ſee the end of the Lord; he began harſhly with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with <hi>David,</hi> and with better than <hi>David,</hi> with Chriſt himſelf, but it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this, he ſet him down at his own right hand, and bade all the Angels worſhip him. Any of you that he is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing a promiſe unto, he is killing, that he may make alive, he is tearing and wounding, that he may heal; he is ſmiting, that he may bind up; however ye may go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weeping, bearing your precious ſeed, yet it will end in rejoycing, bearing your precious ſheaves. 2. I would
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43047:125"/>have you diſtinguiſhed betwixt his diſpenſing of a promiſe, and your ſenſe of it; readily your ſenſe may be directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature o the thing; O but Senſe is an ill judge in the matters of Faith; I deny not, but Senſe will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and confirm Faith, but when it is ſtrengthned in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Faith, it is a great impediment to Faith: I will not believe, except I ſee, ſaith <hi>Thomas,</hi> it was his Senſe that was a great impediment to his Faith; ſo we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt the matter of the work of his diſpenſing, and our ſenſe of the work, like the vulgar people, we will be of one judgment one day, and another judgment another day; one day we will cry, <hi>Crucifie, crucifie him,</hi> and another day cry, <hi>Hoſanna, Hoſanna;</hi> one day we think, there is nothing more real, and another day we think there is nothing but deluſion and ſhall we lay weight on this? But learn to diſtinguiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> betwixt his diſpenſing of the promiſe, and your ſenſe of it. But 2. ye would notice this, if ye would ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent order, both of making and contriving of the Covenant, that it's a Chriſtians duty, ay to bring the providence to the promiſe, and not the promiſe to the providence; we are not to ſay, O in this diſpenſation, he is not true to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but we are to bring the providence, and the lot we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the promiſe; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtaggered not at the promiſe, but judged him faithful that had promiſed; there is one thing that puts the capeſtone on the order of the promiſes, and a luſtre on the Cove ant, that it is ſo full of ſo great, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, in reference to the Church of God, it's true, God hath concealed the time, and the way how he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh theſe promiſes; but believe it, and go home and rejoyce in the hope of it, that all the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of God; Popery, Judaiſm, and Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, will all fall to the ground; the time will come, when Holineſs ſhall be written on Horſes Bells, when Wars and rumors of Wars ſhall ceaſe, and men ſhall beat their ſwords into plough-ſhares, and the Lamb ſhall ly down with the Wolf, and not be afraid; and there ſhall be no more War ſeen in all the nount of God; ye may ſay, there is no ground for this; but the Mediator hath ordered the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and hath put in it, not only the bleſſing of Peace and pardon, and Repentance, relating to the like of thee and me, but he hath put in it the Order of the promiſes, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43047:125"/>to his Kingdom, tho there be no appearances of it, but all things againſt it; yet all that are againſt, are but bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt a wall; for ſhall he cry, and ſhall it not be heard? ſhall he ſpeak, and ſhall it not be done? No, all the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of God; therefore, ye that have your heart broken, with ſomething of the deſolation of the houſe of God, ye may ſee thoſe days afar off, with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and rejoyce, and who can tell, but the Confuſions of <hi>Europe</hi> this day, be the accompliſhment of theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? the time is coming, and is haſtening, and will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in due time, and all the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of God, as the Seas are full of Water; and when ye go to him for your pardon, go to him and proteſt, that ye will not be ſatisfied, except he will fulfill all his promiſes to his Church.</p>

            <p>THE ſecond property of the Covenant of Grace, that it is rightly ordered, I entered on, God who is the God of Order, hath appointed an excellent order in his Covenant; and it's neceſſary for a Believers conſolation, to take notice of it; in handling of it, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak to three things, the Order of the promiſes of the Covenant, the Order of the Commands, the Order of both the Promiſes and Commands, with reference to an end. I have ſpoken to the Order of the promiſes.</p>
            <p>I come now in the ſecond place, to ſpeak to the Order of the Commands of the Covenant, and ye will find it of great neceſſity, for one who would profit by the Covenant; firſt, obſerve the Order of it, there is indeed an excellent Order among the duties of the Covenant; I cannot run through them all, that practick Divines have written about, I will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43047:126"/>reduce what I will ſay of the Order of the Commands, to four heads. (1.) The Covenant hath Ordered Graces and Duties, to be knit together, to make up Obedience to the Covenant; it's not Grace only that fulfill; our part of the Covenant, nor is it Duties only, but is is Graces and Duties knit together; we are commanded in the Covenant to pray, but to pray in the Spirit, we are commanded to mourn for Sin, but we are commanded alſo to believe, and repent; we are commanded to ſuffer when called to it, but if we give our body to the fire and want charity, it profiteth nothing; the commanding part of the Covenant, takes in both Grace and Duties; if a man perform never ſo many Duties, and want Grace, he fulfills not his part of the Covenant; Obedience and Duties without Grace, are like a Carcaſe without a Soul, or a Shell without a Kernel; and in effect, they ſignifie nothing, as to our part of the Covenant; there are ſome, they think they have the truth of Grace, and are negligent in Duties; there are others, they multiply Duties, but they make no conſcience of the Grace that ſhojld accompany the Duties; thou has no kind of order in the Covenant, the Lord hath knit the two gogether, otherways there is no ſuitable frame to the Covenant at all. 2. The Covenant, in the preceptive and commanding part of it, the firſt and principal Grace cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, is Faith; Faith is the ſpecial part of the Covenant required on our part, this is his Command, that is the great command in the Covenant of Grace, for it was not commanded in the Covenant of Works, <hi>that ye believe in his Son whom he hath ſent;</hi> God hath required many things in the Covenant of Grace, but the great thing he hath laid on and commanded, is believing.</p>
            <p>There are three or four things, will evidence the truth of this to you. (1.) Ye ſhall find the great Inquiry he makes, when he Inquires about a perſons Eſtate is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Faith, if ye will but take a view both of his Word and of his Works, ye will find the truth of this; it is evident, that a man deſires to know a thing by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after it; <hi>Joſeph</hi> when his Brethren came down into <hi>Egypt</hi> he inquired, Is the old Man of whom you ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live? So <hi>Joab</hi> when he returned from the Battel, <hi>David</hi> is very inquiſitive, is the young man <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſafe? <hi>Jacob</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:43047:126"/>was much on <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſpirit, and <hi>Abſalom</hi> was much on <hi>David</hi>'s ſo in the Covenant of Grace, ordinarily ye will find, when he hath ado with any perſon, he aſks; <hi>canſt thou believe, doeſt thou believe,</hi> when he lays on the Croſs, it is to try their Faith, 1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>That the tryal of your faith being much more precious than Gold, that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, though it be tryed with fire; might be found unto praiſe and honour and glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> if he delay an Anſwer to prayer, it is to try Faith, as he did with the Woman, he called her a Dog, as if ſhe were not in his Commiſſion, but in the end, he faith, <hi>O Woman, great is thy faith.</hi> (2.) It will be evident, that this is the main thing in the Covenant, in the Order of it, that we ſhould believe, in regard of the great commendation given to it in the Covenant; it's remarkable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. When the whole cloud of Witneſſes, that covenanted wiht God, are brought in beginning at <hi>Abel,</hi> and coming down to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the thing eſpecially commended in them is <hi>their faith,</hi> no queſtion, they had patience and love, but that which the Scripture cryes them moſt up for is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially their Faith; this evidences, that faith the greateſt thing in the Covenant on our part, not only is it the thing that Chriſt makes a ſpecial Inquiry after, but it's the thing of all the Qualifications thou haſt, that Chriſt eſpecially commends. (3.) In regard of the honour put upon it in the work of juſtification, we are juſtified by faith alone without the works of the Law, this is a ſpecial honour put upon it; it's a queſtion among Schollars, why faith only, and not love, is imployed in the work of Juſtification? they give this as the reaſon of it, faith is the meeteſt for it; if ye Inquire why the Eye ſees and not the Hand? Why the Hand works, and not the Eye? The reaſon is, they are fitteſt to be Inſtruments in Seeing and Working; ſo faith is fitteſt to be the Inſtrument of Juſtification, for it's a receiving Grace, it's called a receiving of Chriſt in the Scripture. John 1.12. <hi>But as many as received them, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his Name;</hi> Now, there is no Grace ſo fit to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in Juſtication, where God gives the pardon of ſin as a receiving Grace. A ſecond Reaſon, why Faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the work of Juſtitication, and not Love, becauſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43047:127"/>Faith will not wrong Chriſts honour. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. We are told by the Apoſtle, <hi>boaſting is excluded, by what Law? by the law of works? nay, but by the law of Faith.</hi> v. 28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the law.</hi> Faith excludes boaſting and gives all the honour to Chriſt, if Love or Patience were imployed in the work of Juſtification, they would plead to more meritorious cauſes, but Faith is the inſtrumental cauſe; ſo, no wonder Faith be made the principal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace, in regard it is ſo fit to receive from Chriſt, and it will not wrong Chriſt in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it will plead for merit, in regard it is only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what Chriſt hath beſtowed. But 4. and laſtly, Faith it furniſhes all other Graces work, every other duty is influenced by Faith, patience, repentance, prayer, and love, are influenced by faith, for faith works by love, every other Grace is actuated by faith, ſo until we come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we cannot repent, we cannot ſuffer, we cannot pray; all theſe things, like a body without a Soul, will be dead and lifeleſs things, without this Grace of Faith. Lay all theſe four together, and ye will ſee, that in the Order of the commanding part of the Covenant, Believing hath the precedency of all other Graces and Duties; ſo in the Order of the commanding part of the Covenant, whatever other Duties God hath commanded, he hath eſpecially comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Believing, that is to be the firſt in order of our Obedience, and to have the precedency of all other Graces, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be obſerved, for many think, that they can go about other duties before they believe, and that in a way ſuitable to the Covenant, but they are altogether miſtaken; for there is nothing acceptable to God without Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Order of the commanding part of the Covenant, though Faith be firſt and principally requiried, yet it's not only required; <hi>Papiſts</hi> calumniat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, when they ſay, we preach, and ſay, that Faith is only required, it is the only Inſtrument of Juſtification, it is by Faith only that we are Juſtified; but it's no faith only, that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of Grace, therefore in the order of the Covenant, the obedience to the whole Law comes in after believing; ſuch as would obſerve the order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, muſt be obedient to all the commands of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43047:127"/>it's remarkable, the obedience that the Covenant of Grace requires, hath theſe three Properties, 1. It muſt be new obedience, that is to ſay, obedience from a new heart, and obediedce conform to the tenor of the new Covenant; the obedience is new, when the principle of it is Love; it was of old fear, but it hath a new principle, when the end of it is the exalting of Chriſt, it was of old the exalting of our ſelves 2. The obedience muſt be ſtrict obedience, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you the excellent diſcourſe, that Maſter <hi>Allan</hi> hath wirtten in his <hi>Vinditiae pietatis,</hi> proving, that the holineſs he ſays of a Chriſtian is ſtrict, ay, no leſs ſtrict than that of the Covenant of works requires, every Chriſtian muſt be a Preciſian, and muſt labour to ſtrive and wreſtle, and take the Kingdom by violence; to watch againſt the leaſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ſin, and the leaſt incroachments of it on Chriſt's Honour, or elſe it's no Obedience according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>3ly,</hi> It muſt be perpetual Obedience, <hi>For if the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man fall from his righteouſneſs, all the righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall be forgotten;</hi> So the Order of the Covenant runs, that there ſhall be Graces and Duties, making up our part of the Covenant, and among theſe Graces and Duties, Faith muſt have the precedency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Order of the commanding part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant requires, firſt and principally mortification, and then vivification; ye will find in the promiſing part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there are firſt promiſes, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon them, and I will cauſe them to walk in my ſtatutes:</hi> theſe that ſet to duties, without Mortification of Luſts, obſerve not the order of the Covenant; thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew what a work of Mortification of inward Luſts meant, but performs Duties at random, they may perform Duties, but not according to the tenor of the Covenant: they cannot have peace from the Covenant, that obſerve not the order of it; now in the preceptive part of the Covenant, though he command all the parts of vivication, yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to begin at Mortification, to cut off the old man of Sin, <hi>To cut off the right hand, to pluck out the right eye,</hi> that is to ſay, to mortifie any Luſt, that will be as painful to part with, as our right eye or our right hand, if one ſew a new profeſſion to an old heart, like new wine put into old
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43047:128"/>bottles, or piece of new cloath to an old garment, it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuitable to the Covenant; ſo we ſee the Order of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Covenant, there muſt be Graces and Duties joyned together, the principal Grace in the Covenant is Faith, and where a perſon neglects that, he failw in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal tenor of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Before I come to ſpeak of the realtive Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as it relates to the end, I would have you take notice, that not only is there an order in the Promiſes, and Commands of the Covenant, but the Promiſes and Commands are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently forted together, they are ſweetly joyned; take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the union betwixt the two, and I will ſpeak to a twofold union betwixt them, 1. Take notice how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are unite. 2. How ſtrictly they are unite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take notice how ſweetly they ar unite; for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, Take notice of three things, 1. The Promiſes are ſweet to the Commands, I find ſome Divines caſt it up, they ſay, for every Command in the Covenant, there are at leaſt two Promiſes; I confeſs there are ſome Commands, we may get ten Promiſes relating to them, but take them at the loweſt, there is no Command in the Covenant, but there are two Promiſes for it; ye need not go to think where will I get a Promiſe ſuited to this Duty? ye ſee, that the Promiſes and the Commands are moſt ſweetly unite together, the Promiſes is a Bond on God to give ſtrength for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and readily ye will get two Bonds in the Covenant, for every particular Command. 2. Take notice, how ſweetly they are unite in this, that as the Promiſe influences obedience to the Command, ſo the Command influences, and evidences an intereſt in the Promiſe: the way how to get ſtrength to obey the Command is, to go to the Promiſe, and the way to know, if the promiſe be ours is, to try our obedience to the Command; ſo like two bearing a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they work to one anothers hand. 3. The two joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſweetly together, contribute to keep the heart in an equal frame, the Promiſe holds out the Reward, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand holds out the ſervice, if we had only a Promiſe, we would preſume, and if we had only a command, we would deſpair; and the two laid together, they ſweetly, not only influence one another for our obedience, but the two joyned together, keeps them in an equal ballance, the promiſe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43047:128"/>keeps from deſpair, and the Command from preſumption. So nothing could be ſweetlier joyned together, than the promiſe and the command in the Covenant; we would not want any of them; if we could be ſo fooliſh, as to wiſh the Covenant orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only of promiſes, it had been no way our intereſt, it had rather made againſt us than for us, had we gotten our deſire, it had been among the reſt of the roavings of our Spirit; it's really our intereſt, that we ſhould be ſervants, and to know our intereſt by our obedience; ſo hath he ordered the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant well, that hath twiſted the two ſweetly togegher, in a way ſuitable to our heart, and his Fathers honour.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Obſerve, how ſtrictly they are unite together, obſerve this in three or four things, and they are to be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by all, who would obſerve the Covenant. 1. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that if we have a title to the Promiſe, we are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bound to the Command; to think that we will accept the promiſe, and lay by the Command, as to overturn the order of the Covenant, they are ſo knit together, that as a Woman in Marriage, in her accepting of the Man, ſhe is bound in obedience to him, ſo when whe accept of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or take it according to the tenor of the Covenant, we preſently in that ſame very act of acceptance, are become bound to the Command; it implyes a contradiction to ſay, we have gotten a Promiſe, when we caſt at a Command, when we accept of the promiſing part, we engage to the preceptive part, the reaſon is, in the order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they cannot be ſeparat, they are ſo ſtrongly knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that he that accepts of the Promiſes of the Covenant, he binds himſelf to the Commanding part of the Covenant; on ghe other hand, if we engage to the commanding part, we have a ſtrong Title to the promiſing part, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part if the Covenant, the greateſt and moſt ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it; if there be conſcience made of the commands of it, he hath a Title to all the promiſes of it, the reaſon is, the order of the Covenant, hath joyned the two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſtrictly, that if we engage with the Commands, we have a right to the Promiſes. 2. This ſtrictneſs of the Union betwixt the two in the Covenant, which is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently contrived in the order of it, appears in this, that the commanding and promiſing part of the Covenant, are in all their parts and pendicles, inſeparably joyned together;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43047:129"/>if we have a right to one Promiſe, we have a right to all, we cannot obey one command in the Covenant, and caſt at another, for that overturns, the order, and ſtrict connexion betwixt the parts of the Covenant: I deny not, but one Promiſe may be ſweeter that another, and we may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at one duty than at another, we may get more liberty in one duty than another; but to accept one promiſe, and caſt at another, to accept one duty, and caſt at another, overturns the order of the Covenant, and whoever pretends to the Covenant, and thinks he hath a ſweetneſs from it, and caſts at one duty in the Covenant, and not at another, <hi>He that offends in one, he offends in all, as James</hi> ſays, no, but we may be ſtronger in one thing, and weaker in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a wilfull paſſing by any duty in the Covenant, and ſlighting of it, is an evidence thou deſpiſes it. 3. The ſtrictneſs of the order of the Covenant, betwixt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and the Promiſes, will appear in this, that there is no obedience to the Command can be given, without the Promiſe, and there is no evidence of a right to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, without the Command; they are ſo inſeparably knit, that a man could as ſoon pluck the Sun out of the Frima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſtop the courſe of the Moon, as to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, without the Promiſe, not that I would have you to run away from the duty, but go to the promiſe with it; on the other hand, they are ſo knit together, that it's high preſumption for a man, to lay claim to the Promiſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he give obedience to the Command; however ſome may flatter themſelves, as the diſtracted man at <hi>Athens,</hi> who would go to the Harbor, with Paper and Ink in his hand, and call for all the Ships, and take a Liſt of all the Goods into them, and come away rejoycing, that they are all his; there are many do ſo in the Covenant, they take the Promiſes and count them theirs, but there can be no comfortable evidence of a Title to the promiſe, if we conſcientiouſly obey not the Command; the reaſon of it is, in the order of the Covenant, he that treated and drew the Covenant, in all the contents of it; ſo as there is no Title to the promiſing part, without the commanding part, and no obeying the commanding part without the promiſing part, ſo ye ſee the Order of the Covenant, in reference to the Promiſee of the Covenant, and the Commands of it, and the connexion betwixt the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43047:129"/>Promiſes and the Commands. I ſay no more of the abſolute Order of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Before I compleat this Diſcourſe of the Order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I would conſider the relative Order of it. Order is a right ſituating of things in order to the end. Now, both the Commands and the Promiſes, whether ye take them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, or jointly in the Covenant, are excellently ordered in reference to the ends of the Covenant. To open this unto you, I will ſhew you three ends for which the Covenant of Grace is made with Believers, or with the Mediator in their name, and ye will find both the Commands and the Promiſes excellently ordered, in reference to all the three. (1.) The Covenant of Grace was made to exalt the Father. (2.) It was made to golrifie the Son. (3.) It was made to make the Salvation of the Elect ſure and eaſie. Now in reference to all theſe three Ends, the Covenant is excellently ordered in all things. I will ſpeak a little to this, in regard the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial order of the Covenant, lies in the wiſe ordering of the End, for which it's made. Firſt, I will ſhew you how this Order of the Promiſes and Commands, tends to the honour of the Father. (1.) This Order in the Covenant contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to exalt the Father; there are ſome that write on the Covenant, they offer ſome excellent Reaſons, to prove that the Father hath gotten a great deal more Glory by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Geace, than he hath gotten by the Covenant of Works, even though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood ſtill in his Integrity: I will only let you ſee this in two or three particulars; 1. Conſider the Glory of his Juſtice, the Glory of his Juſtice is exceedingly advanced, indeed he had a great deal of Glory of his Juſtice, when he ſent the Deludge and deſtroyed the old World, and when he ſent fire and brimſtone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> all men might ſee the Glory of his Juſtice in this; but this was nothing to what Chriſt met with from the Father, <hi>Awake, O ſword, and ſmite the man that is my fellow.</hi> Any that heard of the Deludge, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> by fire, would ſay that he is a juſt God, that would not ſuffer ſin to go unpuniſhed; but they that hear of this, that he took pleaſure to bruiſe his own Son and had a delight in the breaking of Him that when he ſtood a Sacrifice in the room of Sinners, he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him one Farthing; when he cryed upon the Croſs with
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43047:130"/>ſtrong cries and tears, being in an Agony, and commanded the Sword to awake, and ſmite the man that is my fellow, he would not ſtay until his Sword was wet with his hearts Blood; is there not great glory in his Juſtice? All the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned for all eternity, declare not his gloy, ſo far as the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt. (2.) It exalts the Father, not only in his Juſtice, but in his Power, all the things that ever he did to declare his Power, the making the World out of nothing, and giving ſo excellent an Order to it, declares him an excellent God: but the Power that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Refurrection of Chriſt, and the working of Faith, which is the exceeding greatneſs of his Power, outſtripes that; when he made the World, he made it out of nothing, but here he brings it out of its contraries, he brings a heart of fleſh out of a heart of ſtone, but the raiſing of Chriſt from the Dead, that had all that the Juſtice of God could do, and all that Satan could do, he roſe and declared himſelf to be the Son of God with power. (3.) If ye take notice of his Wiſdom, he is the only wiſe God: the things that we quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at, we find that he did it in Wiſdom, he hath given great proofs of his Wiſdom, but in nothing more, than what he hath given in the Covenant of Grace; that his Son ſhould come from his Boſom, and be perſonally unite to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in that nature to ſuffer, that man might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; if he take his Mercy, his Love, and his Grace, and the reſt of his Attributes, whatever appeared in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, are all nothing to the contrivement of the Covenant of Grace; ſo the Order of the Covenant, is ſo well ſuited to the end, eſpecially to his Fathers golry, that in all the things that are done, or would have been done, from the beginning of the World to the end, it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo; as by the Covenant of Grace, the Father is exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all, that ever the Angels could deviſe by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. But theſe are but one of the Ends, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his Son, and making the Salvation of the Elect ſure and eaſie, are the two great Ends of the Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                  <p>Although my houſe be not ſo with God; yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my ſalvation. and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</p>

            <p>THere are three ſpecial ends of the Covenant of Grace, the exalting the Father, the glorifying the Son, the making the ſalvation of the Elect ſure and eaſie; all theſe three the Covenant hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that they tend to promove both the Promiſes and Commands; Firſt. The glorifying of the Father, O but he is infinitely far more glorified by the Covenant of Grace, than by all the things that ever he did; but I have ſpoken particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to this.</p>
            <p>I come to the ſecond, the glorifying of the Son, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſo ordered, as the Son is exceedingly glorified; Now, ye would conſider Chriſt in reference to the Covenant, three ways. <hi>2ly.</hi> Conſider, that all the Glory of theſe three, redounds to him alone.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt is the procurer of the Covenant, the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of it, however the Father hath infinite Grace, yet this Covenant was bought and payed for by the Mediator. 2. As he is the Purchaſer, he treated the Covenant, he drew the Contents and all the Articles of it, he drew them to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all Parties. 3. He is the Executor of it, all the Promiſes of it are the accompliſhment of his three Offices; all the Promiſes of pardon, are the accompliſhment of his prieſtly Office; all the promiſes of Holineſs, are the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his prophetical Office; all the promiſes of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are the accompliſment of his kingly Office. Now, ſince he is the Purchaſer of the Covenant, and the Treater of it, and the Executor of it, what a great deal of influence hath he on the Covenant?</p>
            <pb n="254" facs="tcp:43047:131"/>
            <p n="2">2. The glory of all theſe redounds to him, there is none to rob him of them. Some ſuppoſe, the ſtanding angels pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied lapſed Mans caſe, when he was fallen, yet they could not help it, it was above their reach to contrive the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, far more to purchaſe and execute it: ſo the Angels could have no hand in it; and as for men, ſince the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was from eternity, they could have no hand in it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributed more to exalt the Mediator, for he was both the Purchaſer and Treater of it, and payed for it, and execute it, and alone did it, without the help of Angel or man. So the Covenant of Grace, cries down all the Merit and Price, and the glory of the treating of it, and purchaſing of it, redounds only to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Covenant is ordered ſuitably to the third end, to make the Salvation of the Elect have three Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Firſt, Sure; Secondly, eaſie to be attained; and Thirdly, Suitable. 1. It makes it ſure, the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> tho it had a perfect man ſtanding as a Party, yet he was a fallible man. <hi>Adam</hi> could fall, and actually did fall, ſo it was put in the hand of a man, whoſe eſtate was great; but it was poſſible for him to be a Bankrupt and deboiſht, and to make ſhipwrack of his ſtock; that made not the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elect ſure. 2. This Covenant makes the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elect eaſie, for the Cautioner takes a Diſcharge of all things, by way of ſatisfaction and payment, ſo that there is nothing left for us to pay. 3. This Coventant is alſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to have Heaven without Holineſs, is like Pearls on a ſwines ſnout, it will be only the Holy, that will come to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>For without holineſs none ſhall ſee God.</hi> So in effect, the Covenant is ordered in all things, in its Commands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the connection of the Promiſes and Commands, with a reference to the ends for which the Coventant was made, the glorifying of the Father, the exalting of the Son, and making the Salvation of the Elect ſure and eaſie, and then ſuitable to it. I ſhall ſay no more of the ordering of the Covenont, but will now come to the application of the point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> Firſt, Is the Covenant thus well ordered in all things, in its Promiſes and Commands, and with a reference to all its ends? Then firſt, it ſerves for Information and it informs us of theſe four things. 1. That one great Duty, that readily
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43047:131"/>many Chriſtians may neglect, who plead the Coventant, but they take no notice of the order, that the Mediator hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the drawing of the Covenant, this order is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, and I would preſs your Obſervation of the Order of the Covenant, with theſe four or five conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. Not to obſerve the Order of the Covenant, is to reflect on the Mediator, who when he drew one Promiſe, to be accompliſhed before another, and one Duty to be done before another, underſtood what he was doing; he that would have abſolute Promiſes to be accompliſhed, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, and promiſes of our Eſtate in Chriſt, and being in him, before the Promiſes of our fellowſhip with him; he that in the Commands would have believing to be a great Duty, and firſt and principally to be performed, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood well what he was doing; he that obſerves not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant, but ſnatches at a Promiſe, and takes a ſtollen Apple off the Tree that is not his own, he reflects on the Mediator; it was the product of his infinite wiſdom, to order the Covenant, and he that obſerves it not, reflects on the Mediator <hi>2ly.</hi> The Spirit in the communication of Promiſes, and applying them, obſerves the order of the Covenant; the Spirit will not ſpeak peace to him, who is not pardoned; the Spirit will not ſpeak peace to one that is in nature, and without Repentance; the Spirit keeps the order of the Covenant, and if thou obſerve not the order of the Covenant, but will ſnatch at a promiſe of peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon, and at promiſes of pardon without Repentance, and at a promiſe of Repentance, while thou art in a natural ſtate, thou firſt reflects on the Mediatior, that contrived the Covenant, and ſecondly, on the Spirit, that underſtood the method of the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> Not to obſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Covenant, is to make Chriſt the Miniſter of ſin; if one ſhould take that promiſe, <hi>I am he that blots out iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tranſgreſſion, and ſin,</hi> and obſerves not the order of the Covenant, that is a Promiſe made to them that have a right to the Covenant, and to them that are effectually called, and to them to whom the Spirit of Repentance is given, ye that do this, make Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant an occaſion of Sin. <hi>4ly.</hi> Not to obſerve the order of the Covenant, is the high way to a Deluſion, nothing will contribute more to delude the Spirit, and to ſet up a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43047:132"/>peace, than when we lay our head on the cod af a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; if there be a ſound ſleep gotten at all, it will be on that cod; but in the mean time, hath not obſerved the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant. What kind of peace can there be from a Promiſe that a man hath ſtollen, adn that one is making uſe of that hath no right to it? It will be one of the quarrels againſt thee, that thou has broken the Orchard, and ſtolen the Fruit, for thou came not to it in the order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and this is the reaſon, why many their peace is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo eaſie, nor ſo laſtie, nor cannot abide a ſtorm, for they take Promiſes, but not according to the order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>5ly.</hi> And laſtly, not to obſerve the order of the Covenant, brings the ſoul readily under the threatning of God, and in the end, under the curſe of the Covenant; it's a great aſſertion of a great Divine, ſays he, he that ſteals a Promiſe that he hath not a real Right to, hath a real Right to the Threatning; ſo, where the order of the Covenant is not obſerved, the peace that we pretend to have from a ſtollen Promiſe, it turns to grief, and to a real Threatning, and in the end to the Curſe. Theſe Motives preſs you to obſerve the order of the Covenant, I believe there are many, that have been looking to the Promiſes, that have not obſerved this, but ye cannot plead the Promiſes, but according to the order of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> It may be inquired here, what ſhould a Chriſtian do, that he may have a claim to the Covenant in the order of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For opening this to you, and it's the great thing that I deſign, in this branch of the order of the Covenant; I will offer you ſome few Directious, that ye may come to know a Promiſe, according to the order of the Covenant. 1. I would have you to go home, and among other things, lay this before God, that ye have entirely ſubmitted to the order of the Covenant, if ye have not adverted to it before, if ye have thought it enough, if ye have gotten a Promiſe in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ye preſently lay down your head on that cod, and ſung the <hi>requiem</hi> and peace to your ſelf; go now and tell him, that ye ſubmit to the Order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that ye could not make it better; if ye had been at the making of it, it's better ordered, than ye could order it, <hi>For he was Chriſt, the power and wiſdom of God,</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:43047:132"/>that did it; and tell him, ye will take no promiſe again, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it come in by the order of the Covenant; make this one of the Articles of your Indenturing with him, that ye ſhall not raſhly take a promiſe, unleſs ye know the Tree to whom it belongs. <hi>2ly.</hi> If ye would have peace coming in according to the Tenor of the Covenant, labour to have an intereſt in the Covenant, and then plead the Promiſes of the Covenant; your intereſt in the Covenant is made up, by your intereſt in Chriſt, he is the Bride-groom, and the Covenant is the Contract; your Intereſt in him is known, by your effectual calling; I have pitied ſome ignorant careleſs perſons, that tell, they have gotten a Promiſe, but what is their Right to the Covenant of Promiſes? Will ever one get a Promiſe, that hath no Intereſt in the Covenant? They may ſteal a Promiſe, and take an Apple off the Apple tree that is not theirs, and lay their head on that God, and ſleep on it, but it's ſtollen, and they have the curſe for ſtealing the Apple, and breaking the Orchard Labour then to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, that ye may ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> ye may ask the mark of one that hath an Intereſt in the Covenant: if ye married the man in effectual calling, after long wooing of you by the Law, and ye have given your heart to him, and he hath given love to you, ſo that ye may ſay, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine:</hi> but to plead the Promiſe, and have no right to the Covenant, and not to marry the man, is to ſteal a Promiſe off a Tree that ye have no right to. <hi>3ly.</hi> If thou would have a mercy coming in by the order of the Covenant, Obſerve, if the Spirit that accompliſhes the Promiſes of the Covenant, hath made out the abſolute and fundamental pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Covenant, before the conditional; he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Promiſe of Repentance, and then he comes to Pardon, and then he comes to the promiſe of Peace, founded on Pardon; thou that has a Promiſe, that thou thinks hath come in by the order of the Covenant, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath keeped the order of giving thee it, if the Spirit hath given thee it, he firſt takes away the heart of ſtone, and then he ſprinkles clean water, and then he gives the Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and then he will give thee to believe, and then give thee pardon, thou muſt come in this way, or then thou comes not in by the order of the Covenant. So if thou would
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43047:133"/>have thy mercies coming in by the order of the Covenant Obſerve, if the fundamental promiſes, and promiſes of the firſt Graces have been accompliſhed to thee, other ways in the reſt of the promiſes, the Spirit muſt overturn the order of the Covenant, if thou thinks he hath given thee peace, but not in this order and method, thou may cry peace, and make a blaze, but it will go out in the dark of the night; ſo if ye would know, if ye have gotten a promiſe in the order of the Covenant, obſerve theſe Rules. <hi>4ly.</hi> If thou would be at a promiſe in the order of the Covenant, take this rule, obſerve whether thou keeps the order of the Commands of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the order of the Commands in the Covenant, is, firſt believe, and then pray, firſt believe, and then hear, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and then rejoyce; believing is the great condition of our part of the Covenant, becauſe he ſaw believing ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to him, and to his Father, that it would not rob him of his honour, nor wrong Chriſt of his glory, it will not do as readily our love would do, love would plead a kind of Works, but believing pleads only to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtification; ſee that thou rightly obſerve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, according to the order in the Covenant, that is to ſay, when thou goes to vent thy heart to God in a corner, thou haſt firſt believed, and then thou haſt prayed; when thou goeſt to the Church to hear a word, thou has firſt act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith, and then thou haſt heard; if this method be not keeped, thou obſerves not the order of the Covenant. So if ye would know, if the Promiſe ye have gotten, hath come in to you according to the order of the Covenant; obſerve if ye keep the order of the Covenant in your obedience, ye firſt believe, and that makes you take up the Bible and read, and to deſire ſpiritual conference, and uſe Chriſtian fellowſhip; we muſt firſt believe, and then obey, otherways it will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the Covenant, we muſt ask in Faith, and what is not of Faith is ſon. <hi>5ly.</hi> And laſtly, if ye would try, if the Promiſe ye have gotten comes in by the order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venat, I exhort thee to have a holy jealouſie and ſuſpiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ye may have been in a miſtake about that Promiſe, take a view of the Covenant; ye may ſay that we preach doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to folk, but I exbort thee, who hath gotten a Promiſe according to the order of the Covenant, not to doubt, your Peace ſtands on as ſure a ground, as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43047:133"/>Heaven and earth; but we do exhort you, that ye do not lightly lay hold on a Promiſe, otherwiſe into your coming by it, ye have taken an Apple off a Tree that is not yours, and hath but ſtollen a Promiſe; try if ye have ſubmitteel to the Covenant, if ye have a right to the Covenant, and if the Spirit hath made out the abſolute Promiſes, and if your life and converſation hath looked like the order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if ye firſt believe, and then pray, and come to the Church, if theſe be not, I exhort thee to ſuſpect thy ſelf, and rather to quite a Promiſe, than to entertain a deluding peace. So ye ſee the neceſſity of looking to the order of the Covenant, and the rules and marks, whereby ye may try, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promiſe ye have gotten, hath come in by the way of the Covenant, and if it hath not come in ſo, it will be vomite up again, and of all the ill ſmell'd things in the world, that will be one, to ſwallow down a Promiſe and vomit it up again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe of the point, is there ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Order in the Covenant, then I would have thee to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to this Order in the Covenant, and I will offer you four caſes, wherein I would preſs you to ſubmit to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant. I believe there are many, and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der often, that both my ſelf and other Miniſters, that we are not more in preaching ſo neceſſary a truth, that its not more ordinar, to tell people, that they have gotten a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and they obſerve not the Order of the Promiſe. 1. I exhort you to ſubmit to this Order of the Covenant, in your deſires, when we go to God with our prayers, the thing we pray for, is never prayed for right, except we ſubmit our deſires in two things. 1. I deſire you may ſubmit your deſires in trying the things ye make requeſt for, ſubmit to it according to the tenor of the Covenant; do not ſay, give me pardon, when he hath not given Repentance; do not ſay, Juſtifie me, when he hath not effectually called you; for ye bid him in that caſe, overturn the Order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut. <hi>2ly.</hi> I would have you ſubmit to it, in the anſwer of your deſires, many a time we go to him, and of all the fruitleſs works we go about throughout the week, is Prayer; we never know our ſelves a ſtrae-broad better at the Weeks end, than at the beginning of it, when we have been in ſecret morning and evening, and ſometime at midtime of the day, the reaſon is, ye go not to him according to the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43047:134"/>Order of the Covenant, it's an unreaſonable deſire to bid him overturn the thing that his Son hath treated, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own Blood, and payed for; we go to him, and deſires him not according to the Order of the Covenant, we cry, give me Peace, and give me Pardon, and it may be, he hath not given Repentance; therefore learn from this Sermon, to ſubmit your deſires, and the anſwers of them, to the ordering of the Covenant; and I am confident, there are many that uſe to go to God, if ye would caſt up your reckoning, what ye deſired, and the way of your deſires, whatever it was, it was ſomething inconſiſtent with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant, that the Mediator treated. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, I would have you to ſubmit your practice to the Order of the Covenant; ye were hearing, that believing is the firſt and principal thing, and other Duties muſt be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by faith; many when they go to pray, obſerve not this, and when they come to hear, they hear not in faith; what ever they ask, they ask not in faith; they would have Prayer, Hearing, Repentance, without Faith, which is not according to the Order of the Covenant; Submit thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to the Order of the Covenant, when thou goes to God, examine if it be according to the Order of the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> I would have thee ſubmitting thy Enjoyments, to the order of the Covenant; I mean, even thy greateſt Spiritual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Lord hath ordered the Covenant ſo, as he hath the timing of the Peace, and deliverance of his Ghurch, and the communications of his Spirit to his people; many a time we would limit God, in asking peace, and delivering the Church, we bid him do this the day, or to morrow; the Covenant is ſo ordered, as he hath left the timing of theſe to him, who is a Lord of his Liberty; thou that will quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, I was at this Sermon and that Sermon, and I ſaw him not, and I go to him in corners, and I ſcarce find him; ye would take notice, that the ordering of the Covenant, it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the mercy, yet it allows him the timing of it, in the ordering of the Covenant. And laſtly, I would have you to ſubmit to this order in the Covenant, not only your deſires, your practices and your enjoyments, but alſo ſubrnit to it, in every thing, whatever be more comprehended under any of theſe three. O! If this were more obſerved, readily there would be more peace.</p>

The firſt ſhall be a word of Reproof, to them that obſerve not this order, and they are the generality among us; and the truth is, it makes up a frothy Profeſſion, theſe that perform duties without Faith, theſe that have gotten a promiſe, without a right from the Govenant, they obſerve not the order of the Commands and Promiſes: they hear, they pray, they wait on Ordinances, they confer, and have ſpiritual fellowſhip, and in the mean time they do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit of faith; I tell thee, and I cloſe with this part of theſe four Sermons, that thou boſerves not the order of the Covenant, and thou ſhall never be the better of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: It was a well contrived and a wiſely ordered Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ye that think to take Heaven in another order and way, and will not firſt believe, and then do, and thou wilt take a Promiſe, without obſerving the order of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, thou ſhall have <hi>the Lord meeting thee in the valley of deciſion,</hi> with, <hi>what hast thou to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth?</hi> And thou ſhalt have a real curſe, for taking a Promiſe that thou haſt no right to, and ſtealing an Apple off a Tree that is not thine. <hi>2ly.</hi> I exhort all of you, to obſerve the order of the Covenant better; it's a buſineſs of a Heaven and of a Hell, if ye would feed on the conſolations of the Covenant, the bleſſed Jeſus, who was the Wiſdom of the Father, he drew it, treated it, contrived it in ſuch an order, in Commands and Promiſes, and the ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Commands and Promiſes. I exhort you, among all the Sermons preached on this Text, that ye would obſerve the order of the Covenant, which readily may be more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you, than any part of the Bible; but for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that have obſerved this, I have three or four things to ſay to them, and will cloſe with it. 1. Chriſtian, I exhort thee to build on the Covenant, O! it's well ordered. There are ſome Divines regrate, that in our Church we want E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelick Pſalms, taken out of the New Teſtament, on the immediat praiſes, not Typical praiſes, but the expreſs praiſes of Jeſus Chriſt: though I be againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on this head, yet it is a thing we may have drawn up; as <hi>Simeons</hi> Song, and <hi>Maries</hi> Song, to be ſung among us; yet what ever of this be, we are to be be praiſing him, for the right guiding of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43047:135"/>the Covenant; the Father could wiſh no more in the rigour of Juſtice, and we could wiſh no more, in the rigour of Grace, than we have gotten; therefore build nto only on the Covenant, but when ye have any occaſion, ye are to tune over a Song to God, and bleſs him for the order of the Covenant, and for the treating of the Commands of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>2ly.</hi> I would have you making uſe of a main par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the ordering of the Covenant, and the not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making of it, undoes a Believers peace; that is to ſay, 1. The Covenant is ſo ordered, that he is to pay for all our debt. <hi>2ly.</hi> He is to pay for all the infirmities of the heart <hi>3ly.</hi> When there are any failings, that he ſhall accept of the ſincerity of the will for perfection, therefore go ye, and make uſe of the order of his own contriving, he hath done the buſineſs, ſo as there is not a Groat left to thee and me to pay; the Father hath received a ranſom, and he hath payed the whole Shot, he hath ordered the Covenant ſo, as it's not laid on me in the Covenant, to take away my heart of ſtone, but it runs, <hi>I will take away the heart of stone;</hi> now Iſay, preſs this order of the Covenant on him, and be ſupported with it, for your friends, and for your ſelves; and when there comes to be any fail or breach made, and ye have gotten a wound for it, as a Beleiver may have all his bones borken, as <hi>David</hi> had his, <hi>Plal.</hi> 51. know, that he is bound to bind up your wounds, and preſs him with it, for he is abundantly able to pay; never preſs him with leſs than he hath undertaken in the Covenant; preſs him that he would keep you from a deluſion, and from laying a ſtollen Apple to your door, but have firſt a right to the Apple Tree. I will cloſe this, with preſſing you to improve theſe Sermons on the order of the Covenant; I know no Scripture will contribute more for your illumination, than this order of the Covenant, for it may ſhake many of your peaces, therefore go and obſerve the order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                  <p>Although my houſe be not ſo with God; yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</p>

            <p>HAving ſpoken in ſome preceeding Sermons to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant, and ſhewed the neceſſity of obſerving the order of the Covenant, both in its Promiſes and Commands, and rebuked thoſe that ſteal a Promiſe, and lay it as a God to Security to ſleep on, while in the mean time the Promiſe comes not in, according to the order of the Covenant, the abſolute Promiſe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and yet claiming to the conditional Promiſe: A multitude of things of this nature have been handled.</p>
            <p>But I come now to the third property of this Covenant, <hi>and ſure,</hi> it's ordered in all things and ſure; if this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were wanting, all the reſt of the properties would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, for it would not be everlaſting, though it were never ſo well ordered, nor it would not be comfortable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were ſure.</p>
            <p>The word in the Hebrew <hi>Montanus,</hi> renders it <hi>Conditum,</hi> others render it <hi>Munitum,</hi> it is ordered in all things and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; it is a word in the Hebrew, that comes from a Root that ſignifies to guard, a Metaphor borrowed from a Gariſon, when Souldiers uſe to ly in Gariſons together; it's ordered in all things, and guarded and Gariſoned, but our Tranſlation hath it, <hi>It is ordered in all things and ſure,</hi> and accordingly I will take it in handling this Theme.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>ſure,</hi> it imports many things into it, it is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that God will not change not alter, nor yet that he will break; it is called 2 Chron. 13 5. <hi>A Covenant of ſalt;</hi> when <hi>Abijah</hi> comes out to fight with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who had ſtollen <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> ought venot to know, ſays he, that the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> gave the Kingdom over <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:43047:136"/>to <hi>David</hi> for ever, even to him and to his Sons, by <hi>a covenant of ſalt;</hi> now ſalt is the thing that keeps any thing from purrifaction, the thing that is ſalted uſes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; ſo ye find it <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.19. ſpeaking of the Prieſts portion of the offerings, <hi>It is a covenant of ſalt for ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, unto thee, and to thy ſeed with thee;</hi> ſo a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of ſalt, that is, it is a Covenant that will not putrifie nor corrupt. But I will take this property of the Covenant, as it lyes tranſlated in this text, and ſhall propoſe this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>That among many excellent ingredients and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Covenant this is one, that it is ſure, it is ordered in all things and ſure.</hi> The mercies of <hi>David</hi> are called ſure mercies, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.3. <hi>Incline your ear, and come unto me, hear, and your ſoul ſhall live, and</hi> I <hi>will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David. But ye have a remarkable word, to confirm this property of the Covenant, that is ſure, among many others in the Bible, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, if you can break my Covenant of the day and of the night, and that there ſhould not be day and night in their ſeaſon, then may alſo my Covenant be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with</hi> David <hi>my ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. Now, is there any thing ſurer than night and day in their ſeaſon? Since the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the earth was laid, this hath never failed, what ever reelings have been in the world, day and night in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath never failed; now the Covenant is no leſs ſure than night and day in their ſeaſon; a number of ſuch like Scriptures might be brought to prove that it is ſure.</p>
            <p>Now I would inſiſt a little in proving that it is ſure, and then ſhall clear ſome Practical Queſtions about it, and <hi>3ly,</hi> ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, that I may let you ſee that your Faith walks not upon ice, that will crack under you, and break thorow, while you take you to the Covenant, but upon a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, I will offer you reaſons of two ſorts, to prove that it is ſure, and the laying of them together, will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a very rational truth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt give you ſome negative Reaſons; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome poſitive Reaſons; which being laid together will evince that it is guarded, fortified and ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Negative.</hi> For the firſt, the Negative Reaſons
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43047:136"/>that will contribute to prove it ſure, I ſhall reduce them to three heads, or rather there are three things, that uſe to make a Covenant or Bargain unſure, and all the three are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from this Covenant of Grace. 1. Either there muſt be ſomething makes it unſure on Gods part; or 2. There muſt be ſomething on our part; or 3. There is ſomething makes it unſure in the nature and form of a Covenant. Theſe three ordinarily in Bargains makes them unſure, and none of the three can concur, to make this Covenant unſure; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the three, and ye will find is one of the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Bargains that ever was made to any.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There can be nothing on Gods part; there are three things on mens part, that make a Covenant or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unſure, and none of them all concur in God. 1. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten men makes Bargains, and they forget them; it's remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chief Butler, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> had interpretred his dream, promiſed that he would remember him, but when he was advanced to his Dutlerſhip again, he forgot him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.23. But this cannot be incident to God in making this Covenant, Pſal. 111.5. <hi>He will ever be mindful of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> And Heb. 6.10. <hi>For God is not unrighteous, to forget you work and labour of love, which ye have ſhewed towards his Name,</hi> &amp;c. Now, forgetfulneſs in him, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. <hi>2ly.</hi> Severals break their Covenants, not only through forgetfulneſs, but through weakneſs and impotency, they are not able to fulfill them, and therefore they break them; now this cannot be in God, we believe, (and it is the firſt Article of our Greed, and we may believe all the reſt the better that it is there.) <hi>We believe in God the Father Almighty,</hi> He that meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and metted out the Heaven with the ſpan, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, and weighed the moutains in ſcales, and the hills in a bullance, in not he able to fulfill his Covenant? There is no promiſe in all the Bible, but he is able to fulfill it. <hi>3ly.</hi> Severals break their Bargains through unrighteouſneſs, the rew them again; there are ſome make vows to God, and they ſeek out all the evaſions in the world they can get, to ſatisfie their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they may be looſed from thoſe vows; they do (as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſaid ſome do with their Oaths and their Vows) as Children uſe to do with <hi>French</hi> Kyles, they are at a great
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43047:137"/>deal of pains to get them ſet up, and in right order, and when they are all ſet up, they preſently roll a Boul among them, to throw them down again: but this cannot be in God, there's no Attribute in him prejudged by his unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, his mercy, his juſtice, his glory, is more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this Covenant, than the Covenant of Works; ſo he cannot do with his Covenant, as we do with ours; readily they that do ſo with their Bargains and Covenants, they are like a Horſe kept within a Hedge, they are peaceable, but when they break ovee the Hedge, they range over the Countrey; ſo do men with their Covenants, ſo long as they are kept within the Hedge of the Covenant, they ſeek not ſo much after their luſts, but when they have broken over ihe Hedge, they get liberty to follow their luſts; ſo, there can be no failing of the Covenant upon Gods part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> It cannot be unſure on our part, it is true, here would appear the greateſt weakneſs, but it is abundantly ſecured on our part; Remember ye not what ye heard, when I was ſpeaking of the Covenants being everlaſting; That a Believer cannot fall out of a Covenanted eſtate, unleſs God break unto him: Now it cannot be unſure, in regard there are four of five kinds of Promiſes in the Covenant, that makes it ſure on our part. <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are Promiſes of the firſt graces the want of an heart of fleſh, the want of clean water ſprinkled on us, cannot make the Covenant unſure on our part, becauſe all theſe are promiſed. <hi>2ly.</hi> On our part, it's true we have grace, but it cannot act, and one may think, that will make the Covenant unſure, but there are promiſes of influence in the Covenant, Hoſ. 14.5. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lillie, and ſhoot forth is roots as Lebanon. 3ly.</hi> That might make the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on our part, we may break and fall away; but there are promiſes of perſeverance in the Covenant; remarkable it that promiſe, Jer. 32.48. <hi>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> It's made an everlaſting Covenant, becauſe not only God will not turn away from them, to do them good, but he will put his fear in their heart, that they ſhall not depart from him. <hi>4ly.</hi> It may make the Covenant ſeem unſure on our part, that we are guilty, and will not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43047:137"/>that make him break? No, guiltineſs on our part will not break the Covenant, for there are promiſes of repentance, and promiſes of a righteouſneſs of faith, to cover our guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if once we be really in Covenant with him, he muſt break to us, before we can come out of a covenanted eſtate with him. Muſt it not ſtand then on very ſure terms, when there is nothing either upon Gods part, or our part, that can break this Covenant, and make it unſure?</p>
            <p>But thirdly, The Covenant may be unſure, becauſe of the nature or form of a Covenant; and in this covenant, none of theſe two can concur to make it unſure; and Firſt, there is nothing in the nature of it can make it unſure, in Diſputs with ſome, who have laboured to looſe the tyes of National Covenants; there are three things hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt them, it's true, all of them groundleſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt them; but that they be Objections againſt this Covenant of Grace, ye will find them far from having any foundation. 1. They tell us, a Covenant is not ſure, when it is contrair to former lawful Oaths; no queſtion a Covenant about indifferent things, contrair to former law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oaths, cannot be lawful; and the Inſtance they bring is, the tye of the Covenant was contrair to lawful Oaths, and therefore cannot be binding: but this cannot be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in the Covenant of Grace in the leaſt ſhadow of it. <hi>2ly.</hi> They ſay, the Tye of a Covenant cannot be binding, when the matter comes to be impoſſible, the thing we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed when it was lawful, becomes ſinful when it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; yet the Tye of the Covenant, binds us to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our Endeavours, now in the Covenant of Grace, there is nothing in it impoſſible for God, nor can we ſay, from them nature of this Covenant, that there is any thing in it impoſſible. <hi>3ly.</hi> They ſay, a Covenant is not binding, when the nature of it is unlawful; they ſay, if they promiſe to give a man a Sword in his hand againſt ſuch a day, and if the man Diſtract againſt that day, the nature of the caſe is unlawful, and comes to be altered; but this cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the nature of this Covenant, that there is any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance occurring, that God did not forſee, when he made it, and conſequently, there can be nothing in the nature of the Covenant, to make it unſure; go through all the Articles and parts of it, and there is nothing in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43047:138"/>of the Covenant, eſpecially proceeding from God, whoſe Will is the firſt Rule of what is lawful or unlawful, and ye will find nothing that can make it unſure; we maintain in Schools, that there are many things commanded, he might have commanded otherways; for his Will is the firſt rule of Truth and Error; it is his Will that makes this a Truth, and that an Error; ſo that there can be nothing unlawful in it, nothing impoſſible in it, nothing contrare to any former deed or act of his, therefore there can be nothing in all the nature of the Covenant, that can make it unſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> There is ſometimes ſomething in the form of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that will make it unſure, as if one drew a Contract, and drew it not well, he put all things neceſſar into it, but he put in ſome irritant Clauſes into it, that if a perſon fulfill not, and perform not ſuch and ſuch things, then and in that caſe, the Covenant is void and of none effect; but there is nothing in the form of this Covenant that is irritant, he was excellent at drawing the Covenant, he was Chriſt the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God that drew it, it is the product of the Wiſdom of God. <hi>Though we believe not, yet he is to abide faithful,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.13. Likewiſe Pſal. 89.30 <hi>If Davids children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my law, and walk not in my judgements,</hi> &amp;c. Yet v. 34. <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> There is no irritant Clauſe in all the Covenant, that ever will make it unſure; ſo laying all theſe negative Reaſons together, either on Gods part, or on our part, or in the nature or form of the Covenant, ye will find nothing in it at all, that hath the leaſt tendency to inſure it, but it remains ſure, and therefore as it is ordered in all things, ſo it is ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſons Poſitive.</hi> Take ſome poſitive Grounds and Reaſons to prove that the Covenant is ſure, (it ſhall be a witneſs againſt you in the day of the Lord, if ye ſeriouſly improve them not for your advantage) take ſome ſure foundations on which it ſtands and is built, and in them ye will ſee how ſure it is. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. All the promiſes of the Covenant, are the reſult of the Decrees and Purpoſes of God, it is not ſo with the Commands, the Lord may command to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he hath not decreed ſhould be done, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abram</hi> to kill <hi>Iſaat,</hi> and offer him up in a burnt-offering, he decreed not that he ſhould be killed and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43047:138"/>up in a burnt-offering; it is not ſo with the Promiſes of the Covenant, there is no Promiſe, but it is anſwerable to ſome Purpoſe and Decree of God; there is nothing he hath promiſed to do, but he hath decreed it ſo to be; ſo that the promiſes of the Covenant, and the decrees are of equal extent; there are none of them larger and longer than other, what ever is promiſed, is decreed; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſalvation of he Elect, what ever is purpoſed is promiſed, the decree cannot be altered. Pſal. 2.7. <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid to me, thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> His Decrees are ſurer than the decrees of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> there is nothing can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Decree, his Counſel muſt ſtand, ſhall he ſay it, and ſhall it not be? Shall he decree, and ſhall it not come to paſs? What a reflection were it on the unchangeable God, if his Decree could be altered? So the Covenant muſt be ſure. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. This Covenant muſt be ſure, for it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Love as well as his Decree. Jer. 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with everlaſting love, therefore with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I gather thee.</hi> The Covenant is as it were gathering with loving kindneſs, there are ſome acts of Juſtice, that he hath ſeemed to us to change, he commanded <hi>Jonah</hi> to go to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and proclaim it will be deſtroyed, yet he will not deſtroy it; it's true, there was no change in God in that, for he threatned to deſtroy it only conditionally, in caſe they repented not, and they repented; but there is no act of his love, that ever he ſeemed to propoſe, that ever he ſeemed to change; what ever is founded in his love, ye will not find changes of it, except it be to the ſenſe of a Believer; and the Covenant is founded in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love, and conſequently, the Covenant muſt be everlaſting it ſelf, becauſe it is grounded in his love. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. The Covenant cannot be but ſure, in regard it's founded in the Blood of his Son, it's purchaſed by Chriſt: ye have heard, when I was ſpeaking on that, <hi>He hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> when I ſpake of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Covenant, and of the fourfold influence, that Chriſt had on this Covenant, among other things, I told you, he hath purchaſed it, there no Article of it all, but it is the price of his Blood, he gave himſelf and died for that end, that he might purchaſe the Covenant; and ſince
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43047:139"/>it is in every Article of it put chaſed by him; and ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the Father conſented to one Article, or ſubſcribed to one Article of the Covenant, he laid down his life, and ſhed his blood, how can that Covenant alter? Shall his Blood be as the woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> ſaid of <hi>Abſalom</hi> to <hi>David, All we are like water ſpilt upon the ground, that cannot be gathered up again?</hi> Shall his Blood be ſo? That is impoſſible. So, this Covenant ſtanding on theſe three Foundations, is it any wonder, that it be entirely and abſolutely a ſure Covenant, alſwell as a well ordered Covenant? But add in the <hi>4th</hi> place, conſider the Seals he hath put to the Covenant; ſince it is the reſult of his Decree, and of his Sons Blood, and of his Love, theſe were enough to ratifie it; but he hath to do with unbelieving hearts, that ſcarce will credit him, therefore he hath put to many Seals to it; and I will only name you three or four Seals, he hath put to the Covenant to make it ſure. 1. He hath ſealed it with the death of his Son, the death of the Teſtator maketh the Teſtament of force, Heb. 9.16. <hi>Where a Teſtament is, here must alſo he of neceſſity, the death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, for a Teſtament is of farce after men are dead, otherwiſe it is of no force at all, while the Teſtator liveth. 2ly.</hi> He hath Sealed it with the Witneſs of his Spirit, every Believer is ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit, Eph 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo after ye have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe;</hi> it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent confirmation of all the Promiſes of the Covenant, when he gives the Spirit. <hi>3ly.</hi> He hath confirmed it by his Oath, Heb. 6.17 <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly, to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the immutability of his counſet, confirmed it by an oath. Verſe</hi> 18. <hi>That by two immutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong conſolation. 4ly.</hi> He hath confirmed it by the Seals of the Sacraments, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper,</hi> which ſhould make you, when ye hear of the occaſion of the Sacrament of the Supper, to run to it; there are many very indifferent about it, yet in other places, they run to the occaſion in multitudes. All theſe four Seals laid together, prove this Covenant to be ſure, <hi>for whom he loves, he loves to the end.</hi> Lay all theſe grounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and theſe four Seals ſuperadded, and ye will ſee, that there is not the leaſt ground left, to doubt of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, for both as to the negative and poſitive Reaſons, it hath all things that can ſicker a Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:43047:139"/>
            <p>To make way to ſome Queſtions about this ſureneſs of the Covenant, I will give you theſe two things ſuperadded to all the former Grounds to prove it ſure. 1. The Covenant of Grace is ſurer than the Covenant of Nature; now the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Nature is very ſure, the Mountains ſtand firm, and the Sea keeps its ebbing and flowing; the Sun keeps his courſe, and the Moon keeps her courſe, and loſes not an hour, and the Stars keep their courſe; ſo that a man may prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat all the Eclipſes to the end of the World; the reaſon is, the Covenant of Nature is ſo ſure, and the Order given to them is ſo ſure, as there may be a ſure Prognoſtication given, of all the changes to the end of the World, yet they are not ſo ſure, as the Covenant of Grace; he may alter the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Nature, and not be unfaithful, he may make the Fire not burn, he may make the Sun ſtand ſtill, he may make the Iron ſwim, he may make the Hills skip like Lambs, he may divide <hi>Jordan,</hi> and may alter many things in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Nature, and not be unfaithful; but if he alter one Article in the Covenant of Grace, if he glorifie not one that is Redeemed, and pardon not one that is a Penitent, he would be unfaithful, he would deny himſelf; for God may alter and overturn things in nature, but he cannot alter one Clauſe of the Covenant of Grace, without a reflection on his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. <hi>2ly.</hi> This Covenant of Grace is no leſs ſure, than the Covenant of Redemption, that was made betwixt the Father and the Mediator; for in effect, it is a Stream of that Ocean: there are many of our Divines, that continue ſtill to make the Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one Covenant; Mr. <hi>Dickson</hi> hath diſtinguiſhed them, and as appears very rationally, they having diſtinct Articles, and diſtinct Parties, but whether they be diſtinct Covenants, or Equal, they are equal in the point of certainty, they are not ſurer than other. So that if Chriſt might break one Article of the Covenant of Grace, he might break one Article of the Covenant of Redemption.</p>

            <p>IT is one ſweet Property of the Covenant of Grace, that it is <hi>ſure,</hi> I laboured to prove this in the Forenoon, and before I apply this Doctrine, there are two practical Queſtions, I will but briefly touch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> The firſt is this, is not the Covenant unſure in ſome things? Particularly, is it not unſure as to the date and time of the accompliſhment of the Promiſes? Who can tell when he will bring in the <hi>Jews,</hi> or when the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> will come, or when he will give deliverance to his Church, or when he will return to a Believer, whom he hath deſerted? Do we not find the Promiſes generally <hi>ſine die,</hi> there is no day nor term put in the Promiſes? Who would take a Bond, and count it a ſure Bond, that had no term nor day ſet down in it? And doth not this render the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unſure? Now for clearing of this Queſtion, I deſire ye may take notice of theſe three things. 1. It's true, the Promiſes have not a day ſet down, they that will ſit down, and tell within ſuch and ſuch a time, ſuch and ſuch things will come to paſs, they are adding to the Covenant their own Inventions; yet we have in the Covenant ſeveral things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the term and day, that are ſufficient, and ye will find four things relating to the Term and Day. 1. Ye find the Viſion is for a ſet time, there is a determinat time with God, Pſal. 102.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come;</hi> So we know, and may comfort ourſelves in this, that there is a ſet time of the accompliſhment of the Promiſes with God. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 2.2, and 3. <hi>verſ, And the Lord anſwered, and ſaid, write the viſion, and make it plain upon tables, that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:43047:140"/>he may run that readeth it, for the viſion is not yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lie, though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> 2. We have this relating to the Term, that it will be a ſhort time; it's among the laſt Letters that we received from the Mediator of the Covenant, Rev. 22.12. <hi>Behold I come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work ſhall be.</hi> He is making all the haſte he can, he will not tarry, nay he will come quickly, and that is more than he will not tarry. <hi>3ly.</hi> We have this in the Covenant, that that time will be a ſeaſonable time, when he comes with the accompliſhment of the Promiſe; It will be a ſeaſonable time, 1 Pet. 5.6. <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. For he ſaith, <hi>In a time acceptable I have heard thee,</hi> &amp;c. That is, a ſeaſonable time; now what would we have more? Is there any uncertainty in the Promiſes, though they be <hi>ſine die,</hi> or though they be given as a Bond without a Term? When he hath put in all theſe, that there is a ſet time, and that it will be a ſhort time, and accompliſhed in a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time? But I add ſecondly, that though there be not a dyet in the Promiſes, and God delay the accompliſhment of the Promiſes; yet his delaying the accompliſhment of the Promiſes, and not putting in a day, are for our advantage. I will offer you three things remarkable, in Gods delaying the accompliſhment of the Promiſes. 1. Sometimes he will delay one Promiſe, and yet be accompliſhing another, the Promiſe that we would be at, we ſtand in need of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of another before it come, ſeveral times he delays the Promiſe of Pardon, becauſe we have not been humbled enough, we are waiting for the Promiſe of Peace, and he follows us with a challenge, or a trouble in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the Wars ſeems to grow now, the delaying of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Peace may be advantagious, for the ſore muſt be ript us, before any thing can be applyed for healing: this delay is our intereſt, though we expect (when we take our ſelves to a Promiſe) that we muſt have the Peace, the quiet, the joy, that Believers have; you miſtake it, the Wound muſt be lanced better, before any healing can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. <hi>2ly.</hi> Sometimes he delays the accompliſhment of the Promiſes, and we learn ſome Duties in the time of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:43047:141"/>delay, that readily we would not have learned, if we were enjoying the Promiſes; ſeveral times the delaying of the Promiſe, puts us to the exerciſe of Patience, Heb. 10.36. <hi>For ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye may inherit the promiſe;</hi> after the will of God is done, there is need of patience; hardly is patience more tryed by Priſon, or by any affliction, than it is by the Soul that that is waiting for the accompliſhment of the Promiſe; often they will be at, <hi>why delays he his coming, fails his word ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi> However Faith be a delaying Grace, yet in us it is often mixed with haſte; ſo while he delays the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Promiſe, he teaches patience, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe we have for patience, it will be hereaway; therefore <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Let patience have its perfect work;</hi> and that we may learn this Leſſon, he will delay the accompliſhment of the Promiſe we wait for. I add <hi>3ly.</hi> This delaying the accompliſhment of the Promiſe, makes nothing againſt the ſureneſs of the Promiſe; 2 Pet. 4.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as ſome men count ſlackneſs, but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance;</hi> it's remarkable, the Lord pronounced a curſe againſt the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the poſterity of <hi>Ammon,</hi> that never lighted on them, until the birth of the Promiſe; the date of the Promiſe, and of the threatning, may tryſt together; ſo theſe delays makes nothing againſt the ſureneſs of the Promiſes; the Clock will ſtrike when the hour comes, the Promiſe will riſe as punctually as the Sun riſes, and the threatning will go down as punctually as the Sun goes down, it varies not from its appointed courſe the time that he hath ſet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. The ſecond Queſtion is, can the Covenant be ſure, ſince he varies and changes? He will give one thing for another, ſometimes he will give a ſpiritual thing for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; as for example, take the Promiſe annexed to the fifth Command, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee;</hi> now one may honour their Father and their Mother, and yet go ſoon to the Grave; how is he true then to his promiſe? doth not he varie and alter, when for ſo long a day he gives Glory?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer to this. 1. In regard of temporal things,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:43047:141"/>he will alter and change a temporal thing for a Spiritual and Eternal; but this ſays not, that the Covenant is not ſure; ſuppoſe a man promiſe his Neighbour an hundred weight of Lead, and when he looks for the accompliſhment of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he ſends him a thouſand weight of Gold, would ye count that man a breaker of his Promiſe? Or becauſe of this, would ye count the bargain unſure? He that is better than his Promiſe, is no breaker of his Promiſe. Now that varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proves not the Covenant unſure. <hi>2ly.</hi> God cannot varie nor alter, in diſpenſing the Promiſes of the Covenant, as to Spiritual and Eternal things, there is nothing he can give in the place of Pardon, or in the place of Heaven, no, He does in this as a Father with an Heir, he may in Summer give him one ſort of Clothes, and in the Winter give him another; he may change his Dinner or his Supper, but he cannot alter his Inheritance, he cannot give any thing in the place of that: Theſe Promiſes we may be peremptory in preſſing, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of which muſt be accompliſhed <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or in the kind; there is ſome Debt payed by permutation or change, and there is ſome Debt payed <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> theſe Spiritual things in the Covenant cannot be payed by permutation, but they muſt be payed <hi>in ſpecie;</hi> in Spiritual things He cannot varie. O! They are ſo great Promiſes, ſuch as the Promiſes of his Son, the Promiſes of Himſelf, and of all things purchaſed by him; that to ſpeak with reverence, it is impoſſible for God to make greater Promiſes; ſo that ye ſee, though there be no day in the Covenant, and though there be ſome latitude left in the Covenant as to temporal things, yet none of them make againſt the ſureneſs and ſtability of the Covenant, but it's a Covenant ordered in all things and ſure.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall apply this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in three practical <hi>Uſes,</hi> and ſo put a cloſe to the Property of the Covenant, that it is <hi>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt, Is this Covenant ſo ſure, ſurer than the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Nature, founded on ſuch ſure Foundations, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſuch ſure Rocks, ſuch as the love of God, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, the purchaſe of Chriſt, and ſealed with His Oath, having all theſe negative and poſitive Reaſons, being ſure in the Nature and Form of it, without any irritant Clauſes; and ſo ſecured on our part, that he muſt break, before we fall out of a Covenanted ſtate? It ſerves for. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that in theſe three particulars. 1. Is the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:43047:142"/>Covenant ſo ſure? Then be informed of what a ſure bargain they make, that can ſay, <hi>The Lord hath made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. The nature of the Covenant will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abide, and our appetite after it will always grow; there are ſome things that we ſet our hearts upon, ſuch as our Strength, our Comelineſs, our Riches, our Reputation, and Credit, and they take the wings of the morning and are gone, when we would faineſt enjoy them, there are other things we ſet our hearts upon, that abide with us, there are ſome things we love, we come to loath again. O! how will we loath the things we ardently loved? but both remain here; the things contained in the Covenant are ſure, and our appetite after them will eternally grow; what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bargain muſt they make, they who are every day feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death gaining ground on them; what an excellent bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain do they make, that have an intereſt in this Covenant? That word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. at the cloſe, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> why draw near? <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>my heart and my fleſh faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever;</hi> Now what can we ſay <hi>for ever</hi> to? Ye cannot ſay, my Husband, my Wife, my Eſtate, my health are for ever, <hi>but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> May it not be cryed in the ears of many, to whom I have been preaching this quarter of a year, (Why ſpend ye your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not bread, incline your ear and hear, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of <hi>David?</hi>) All ye that busk a flower that will wither in your hand, will ye be invited to get an intereſt in this Covenant, and it will ſtand by you, and be ſure, when all other things will bid adieu to you; produce your Tack of Time, and of your enjoyments if ye can? But there are ſome nothing will prevail with them, no not though an Angel ſhould come down from Heaven and preach to them, they will only give it a hearing, like one hearing a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Song, or hearing one playing on a well tuned Inſtrument of Muſick, but it would get no impreſſion the heart, <hi>As many as were ordained to life believed. 2ly.</hi> Is it ſo ſure? Then ſee the obligation ye have to the Mediator of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that as he ordered it well in all things, in all the Articles and Clauſes of it, ſo he reſolved on ſecurities for it, that to ſpeak it truly, were more than neceſſar; it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43047:142"/>in the Covenant, God hath given Securities, that were more than neceſſar to ſecure it, they were rather ſuited to our unbelief, for whom he treated the Covenant, than to the neceſſity of the thing; he knew he had to do with unbelieving hearts, that would be conſtantly doubting, and ſeeking ſecurity of this and that, and I appeal to any of you, when ye have gotten all theſe Confirmations and Seals ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, would ye not ſometimes ſeek a Sign to confirm it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or then ye will not believe? But the Mediator in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant, hath driven the nail, and rooved it ſo faſt, that there were no poſſibility to draw it again: O! this obligation we have to him, ought to make us take with the reelings of all other things the better, that he makes one Fatherleſs, another a Widow, and another ſick, when we find our lot all reeling in the World, we ought to take it well, ſince he hath treated the Covenant well and ſure. How well may ye bear with all the reelings and changes in your Lot, and variety of Diſpenſations ye are tryſted with, ye are tryſted with one caſe this year, and another the next year, but all ſhould be welcomed, ſince the Covenant is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. <hi>3ly.</hi> Is the Covenant thus made ſure, then ſee from it, what weight may be laid on the Promiſes, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of it, ſometimes his People will be with the Promiſes, as men walking upon Ice, that will crack and fall in, and drown them; ſome prophane Rantars dare not hazard upon the Covenant, and the Promiſes of it, they count them all Fanaticiſme, and count them all Fanaticks that take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevles to the Covenant, and the Promiſes of it; and even Believers are at, <hi>What is become of his Promiſes, doth his word fail for evermore?</hi> O! but his Teſtimonies are ſure; they are Secured, and Ratified by more than was neceſſar to ſecure the thing, there are many things added, becauſe of our unbelief, Chriſt thought we would ſcarcely truſt him, therefore he would have them Sealed with his own Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly for Uſe, is the Covenant ſure? It ſerves for Exhortation, and it exhorts to theſe two things. 1. Is the Covenant thus ſure? Then Chriſtian, labour to make it ſure to thee, it is one thing to be ſure in it ſelf, and another thing to be ſure to me; Divines diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>certitudo mentis, &amp; certitudo entis,</hi> the certainty of the thing, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43047:143"/>the certainty of the mind about that thing; now if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it ſelf, make it ſure to thee; if it be not ſo, thou ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>2ly.</hi> Is the Covenant thus ſure, as ye have heard? I exhort you, not only to make it ſure to you, but ſince God hath made it ſo ſure, labour ye to be ſure to him; it's true, if we be once in Covenant, we cannot fall out of a covenanted eſtate again, the promiſes of Grace, the promiſe of Influences, of Pardon, of Repentance, and a gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Righteouſneſs, they are all ſecured to us in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet this opens no door to ſecurity, if we would have the Covenant indeed ſecure, as it is ſure upon Gods part, we would labour to be ſure to him; and here I offer you three things. Firſt, Severals come under Vows and Obligations
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43047:144"/>to God, ſometimes at the Sacrament of the Supper, and ſometimes under affliction, and they break over them again. And O! but it's a dreadful thing to break upon the Lord, it is a notable Bridle upon the head of corruption, to bring it under a vow. <hi>I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and how ſhall I go back?</hi> Says <hi>Jeptha,</hi> if the thing be commanded of God, that thou haſt vowed, thou has a double tye upon thee to keep it; but if it be indifferent, the Lord prizes it highly; ſee an Inſtance of this in the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> Jeremiah 35.6. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab the ſon of Rechab our father commanded us, ſaying, ye ſhall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your ſons for ever,</hi> &amp;c. and they keeped it; and three hundred years after this time, <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> could not perſwade them to drink Wine, when he ſet pots full of Wine before them, they ſaid, we will drink no Wine; and the Lord commended them for it, and promiſed them <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. that <hi>Jonadab</hi> ſhould not want a man to fland before him for ever. So if thou would make the Covenant ſure to thee, take heed thou break not over thy vows, leaſt God give thee over to follow thy luſts. <hi>2ly.</hi> I exhort thee to walk dependently upon God, like a Child that dare not truſt his own legs, if he be young, upon the top of a Rock, or in a windie day, therefore he goes in his Fathers hand; if thou would be ſure to God, never neglect Prayer morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and in all thy buſineſs, go to him in Prayer: the man anſwered well, when he was asked what wilt thou do with ſuch a buſineſs? I muſt go to God, ſays he, and know his mind; the perſon that can ly down with Prayer a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He is not walking in his Fathers hand, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own legs. <hi>3ly.</hi> Chriſtian, if thou would be ſure to him, be oft examining thy caſe, let us not run on like a Bankrupt, that never examines his caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Thirdly for Uſe, Is the Covenant ſo ſure? Then improve it for conſolation; I know not how many ways pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically it might be improven, for the conſolation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 1. It might be improven for conſolation, it reference
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43047:144"/>to all the reelings of times; I doubt if any generation have ſeen mo reelings, and that to the worſe, than this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what a deal of toyling, toſſing, and alteration there is, and hath been; but the Covenant is ſure, reel times as they will, and ſerve that reeling Maſter who will, there is no alteration in the Covenant, for it is ſure. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's a great Cordial againſt all the revolutions of our caſe, ſome days we are refreſh'd and cheerful, and another day we are caſt down and diſcouraged, yet this is conſiſtent with the ſureneſs of the Covenant; rejoyce in the certainty of the Covenant, under all theſe viciſſitudes and changes, alterations of Providence, as this reeling World is full of them, whiles Winter Showers, and then Summer Blinks, to's and fro's, ups and downs, are the ordinary and conſtant lot of men, ſo long as they live in time; but yet the Covenant is ſure, there is no alteration there, the Mediator hath driven the Nail, and rooved it ſo faſt, that he hath gotten his Fathers Oath for all the Articles of it, and ſealed it with his own Blood. O! how may this make you, who can give an account of all the changes, the ups and downs ye have met with, whiles a bit of Meadow, and then a Hill, whiles a Burn with ſome Briars about it, and then a Brae; How ſweetly may they ſing? [The Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure;] Since the day he treated this Covenant, it's like a Rock; nay, ſince <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days, nay, more ſince eternity; ye heard, it was Contracted from eternity in the purpoſe of God, there was not, nor will be the leaſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it to all eternity.</p>
            <p>But to cloſe this Diſcourſe, I will ſhut it up with theſe two words. 1. I would have you now and then taking a view of this Covenant, greater and better things cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired than are contained in this Covenont; ye have now heard many Sermons upon it, wherein all the things that I judge neceſſary, to be ſpoken to, and many moe yet to be ſpoken to, have been handled; I would have you make uſe of all the helps ye can get from the Covenant, and be often ſorting the Promiſes, as Apothecaries uſe to do
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43047:145"/>with Herbs, laying them in Eundles together, that when ye have to do with ſuch a Promiſe, ye may know where to get it, and after ye have conſidered the Covenant in all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of it, add to it, theſe are all ſure. <hi>2ly.</hi> The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Ranters, and theſe that come under temptations from Satan, they queſtion not, but that the Covenant is great, the Promiſes exceeding great and precious, but all the matter is, if they be ſure; this is the thing that makes ungodly men lay their ſouls at the Stake for a while of their luſts; they reſolve to take a time of it, and the ground of it is, the Covenant is not ſure; but be taking a view of all the particulars ye have gotten laid down before you this day, and be perſwaded, there is no greater certainty, that the Sun will go down the night, and riſe the morn, and the Moo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43047:145"/>and that which <hi>David</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uilds on this Covenant ſo qualified; and there are two great things he builds on it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> All his hopes of Salvation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Satisfaction to all his deſires, <hi>this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire;</hi> now me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s deſires are vaſt, it is not eaſie to find that one thing that will ſatisfie all our deſires, but ſaith he, <hi>this is all my aeſire,</hi> or that ſatisfies all my deſires, I deſire no more, ſince he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure.</p>
            <p>But I will take the firſt of them to be the Subject of ſome few Sermons, <hi>this is all my ſalvation,</hi> the word in the Hebrew <hi>Col-ſegni,</hi> it's rendered by <hi>Montanus, cuncta ſalus mea;</hi> theſe words are not in the Hebrew, but ſupplyed by Interpreters, as being implyed in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; it's a pathetick expreſſion, <hi>all my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> but theſe words are put in to make up the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Before I can reach what I deſign, there are two Textual doubts neceſſary to be cleared: 1. What is meant by ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? 2. How this Covenant can be called all his ſalvation? For the firſt, What is meant by ſalvation? The word ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſeveral ſenſes in Scripture, it's ſometimes put for the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo ye find it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, 4. ſpeaking of the word of the Goſpel delivered by Chriſt, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?</hi> That is, the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ordinarily it's put in Scripture, as ye will find it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. laſt Verſe, <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter to them, who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> that is of Heaven.</p>
            <p>The other difficulty is greater, how can the Covenant be called all his ſalvation, or all his Heaven? Are there not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of pleaſures at his right hand, and who would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take the Covenant for all their Heaven? For Anſwer to this, take notice that there is a figurative ſpeech in this, the object is taken as including the act relating to its object; ſome read it, <hi>is all the conduit or channel through which my ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation runs;</hi> but the current of Interpreters take it thus, <hi>this is all my hope of ſalvation,</hi> as in the following words, <hi>this is all my deſire,</hi> the act of the ſoul is taken, that is, this is ſufficient to all my deſires; ſo here, the object is taken as including the act, <hi>this is all my ſalvation,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>this is all my hope of ſalvation.</hi> That ye may be perſwaded of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43047:146"/>this the more, thak notice, 1. That ſalvation is ſometimes taken in this ſenſe in Scripture, as <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. <hi>This day is ſalvation come to the houſe,</hi> that is, <hi>this day is the hope or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racne of ſalvation come to thy houſe,</hi> ſays Chriſt to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he called him down from the Tree. 2. Ye ſhall find one, even <hi>David,</hi> in perſonal Covenanting with God, who uttered theſe words, expreſſing very confidently his hope of ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O my ſoul thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Which generally is underſtood of perſonal Covenanting; but <hi>verſe.</hi> 9. <hi>For this my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope;</hi> there ye have him building the hope of ſalvation on this Covenant, his fleſh ſhall reſt in hope, on the account of his entring in a perſonal Covenant with God, this is all my hope or aſſurance of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But there rermains a third difficulty, how can this be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all his hope of ſalvation? Is not Chriſt and mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the grounds of his hope of ſalvation? Shall I rob Chriſt to clothe the Covenant with the honour due to him? But the Covenant is as the Caſe, and Chriſt as the Jewel, for all the excellency of the Covenant comes from Chriſt; this as ye ſhall hear, excludes the Covenant of Works, and it's one of the places ſome bring againſt Juſt fication by Works; but this Covenant neither excludes Chriſt, nor mercy, no, they are like the blood that run through all the Veins of the Covenant, ſo <hi>this is all my ſalvation,</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, <hi>this is all my hope of ſalvation.</hi> If any ſhall aſk, what ground have I to hope that I will come to glory? This is all my hope of ſalvation, that God hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, and this is all my ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Haying cleared the words to you, I will take two Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſhall be but briefon the firſt, that I may come to the ſecond. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That Believers have in their ſtraits, and eſpecially at their death, the hope of ſalvation for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement <hi>Obſerve</hi> 2. That all the ground of their hope is, that God hath inade with them an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's founded on the Covenant of Greace, and on their perſonal and proper intereſt in it, theſe two ly natively in the words, and hearken to them, if ye would have ſome of the greateſt things of greateſt concernment, cleared unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> For the firſt, <hi>That believers have the hope of ſalvation,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43047:146"/>as an encouragement in their greateſt affliction, but eſpecially at death. David</hi> is at his laſt words, as the beginning of the Chapter tells us this, many proofs ye have in Scripture of this, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18. <hi>Jacob</hi> is making his Teſtament, and tells his Children what will befall them, and what I Legacy he leaves them, and in the midſt of it, he puts in ſomething for himſelf, Lord, ſaith he, <hi>I have waited for thy ſalvation,</hi> he takes this portion to himſelf, and encourages himſelf with it; it were needleſs to prove this, that blievers have in their ſtraits, and at death, the hope of ſalvation to encourage them with, the Martyrs have waſhen their hands in the flames, and counted them Beds of Roſes, becauſe of the hope of ſalvation; ſome of the Martvrs have told their neighbours, let us walk a while in the fire, and in the twinkling of an eye we will be at our Fathers houſe: When they were weeping over Maſter <hi>Ridley</hi> in his houſe, do not weep for me, ſaith he, for I ſhall have a ſharp Dinner, but I ſhall have a good Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Before I apply it, I would inquire a little in the Doctrinal part, how it is? or when it is, that the hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation proves ſo great an encouragement in ſtraits, and at death to Believers? Whence is it, that it proves ſo ſupporting?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For opening this to you a little, ye would notice theſe four or five remarkable things, <hi>First,</hi> the back that bears affliction is patience, now the hope of ſalvation ſtrengthens patience, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. The Apoſtle joyns theſe three together, <hi>Your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſight of God and our Father.</hi> I deny not, but there is in affliction a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold patience; there is, as ſome call it, a deſperate pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, men force themſelves to be patient; for many are at, <hi>there is no hope for me in God,</hi> we will walk after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our own hearts; and there is a ſtupid and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant patience, like the patience <hi>Nabal</hi> had in his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O ſo couragiouſly as he ſpeaks to <hi>David</hi>'s Meſſenger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Who is David? or who is the ſon of Jeſſe? There be many Servants now a days, that break from their Maſters, Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my fleſh that I have killed for my ſhearers, and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be?</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. when <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi> his Wife had told him, after he had been drunk, what was <hi>David</hi>'s purpoſe, his heart grew ſtupid, or <hi>his heart
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43047:147"/>died within him;</hi> Many have ſuch patience, that wears off when the ſtupidity wears off; but none of theſe are the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence of hope; ſo long as hope laſts, patience laſts, and it's eaſie to go through affliction, and hope put betwixt the Lord and it. 2. It's an encouragement, in regard it not only helps its patience, but it influences joy, <hi>we rejoyce in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, knowing that tribulation worketh experience, and experience patience, and patience hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> It's obſerved by ſome Divines, that there are two Graces that hath a ſpecial influence on a Believers joy, Faith and Hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>After ye believed, ye rejoyced with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> The reaſon why theſe two Graces influences a Believers joy is, Faith aſſures what Chriſt hath done, and Hope aſſures what he will do; now lay theſe two together, the aſſurance of what Chriſt hath done, and will do, is it any wonder that there be a great deal of chearfulneſs in tribulation? Faith hath anfluence on our joy, and ſo upon our hope, and he that goes through the valley of the ſhadow of death, and the heart filled with chearfulneſs and joy, is it any wonder that he be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and be not damped with affliction? 2. This hope of ſalvation is a great encouragement, in regard it fills the heart with an earneſt longing after ſalvation, ſuppoſe it be in the caſe of death, none longs more for Heaven, than thoſe that have aſſurance of it: It's a remarkable word ye have <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>And not only they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body, for we are ſaved by hope:</hi> Mark here, they that have received the firſt fruits of the Spirit, ſhould be longing, now we groan, why groan we? We long for glory, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts they have gotten of glory, are appetizing, and makes them long, yea groan for it. The perſons that have no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional hope of glory, are indifferent about it, when the Lord tryſts with affliction that threatens death, he that hath the hope of glory, knows he is near the thing that he hath been groaning for, no wonder it prove a ſpecial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, in regard it's an anſwer of the groaning, that they that have had the firſt fruits of the Spirit have been groaning for. 4. This hope of ſalvation, cannot but be a ſpecial encouragement in affliction, and at denth, becauſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43047:147"/>this hope of ſalvation influences contempt of the world; there is nothing will make the world more deſpicable in ones eyes, than the lively hope of Heaven; it's rremarkable that is ſpoken of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 11. 9. <hi>By faith Abraham ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange land;</hi> and what moved him to ſojourn in this land? <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>For he looked for a city that had foundations, whoſe builder and maker was God:</hi> Could not <hi>Abraham</hi> be content with <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was a pleaſant land, a land that flowed with milk and honey? But the thing that made him look upon this land, as a thing not much to be priſed, <hi>he looked for a city that had founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe builder and maker was God;</hi> the hope he had of Heaven, made him think little of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Ordinarily an earthly man hath nothing, if ye take the world from him, to counter-ballance the loſs of it with; but take <hi>Canaan</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> it will not much trouble him, for he looked for a City <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is a great encouragement under any tribulation, when we can get an heart to contemn the world, for it is that Pitch that ſticks to our fingers, that makes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflictions or death ſo grievous; but where a perſon hath gotten the hope of ſalvation, he looks on the world as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> looked on <hi>Canaan,</hi> he looked on it as a ſtrange Land, and looked for a City that had foundations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. The hope of ſalvation proves a great encouragement, in regard of Hope, eſpecially when the Soul comes to the full affurance of Hope, it hath aſſurance of theſe three things, 1. It aſſures the ſalva ion to be certain, for hope grounding it ſelf on Faith, hath apprehended its object; for Faith and Hope have the ſame object, but diverſly conſidered; Hope brings in Aſſurance of the certainty of the object, ſo where the Soul comes to a lively hope of ſalvation, it's ſure. 2. Hope brings Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the object is tranſcendent, that the ſalvation looked for, will counter-ballance all the afflictions of time, <hi>The light afflictions of this preſent world,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed;</hi> and what a ſpecial Cordial is this in affliction, and at death? 3. Hope diſcovers the ſubſerviency of afficton to Glory, through much affliction we muſt enter into Glory: It may be ſaid of every Chriſtian, as Chriſt ſaid to the two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples going to <hi>Emmaus, Ought not he to ſuffer theſe things?</hi> Now, when one comes to be lively in the hope of ſalvation,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43047:148"/>it not only aſſures, this is a rock, a reſting place, but it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that all our afflictions will be ſwallowed up in that. Now lay all theſe together, the influence that the hope of ſalvation hath on patience, and joy and groaning after glory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, and that it hath in it the aſſurance both of the glory to come, and the tranſcendency of the glory, and the ſubſerviency of affliction to that glory; I ſay, lay them all together, and I hope ye are convinced, that the hope of ſalvation is a ſpecial Cordial, though ye were under the greateſt affliction, and even at your laſt words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. The ſecond Queſtion I ſhall clear, what is this hope of ſalvation, that is ſo great a Cordial in affliction and at death? It's true, we have no expreſs definition of Hope in our Catechiſm; many think it's included in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, it being an act, whereby we rely on God for the good promiſed, and not yet accompliſhed, differing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Faith in that, that the object of Faith is preſent, and the object of Hope is future; but that ye may know what this hope of ſalvation is, I will deſcribe it thus, <hi>It's a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace, wrought by God in the heart of a believer, whereby he expects and wairs for from God, the good of the promiſe not yet accompliſhed.</hi> It's a ſupernatural grace, grace cannot be the hope of ſalvation in a natural heart, there cannot be a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope in a natural heart, nay, Heathens cannot have this lively hope, they have had ſome hope of reſemblance ſince the Fall, their hope is like an old Tower, that is all fallen and ruinous, ye find ſome pieces of the Wall ſtanding, which tells there was once a ſtately Houſe there, but now there is nothing but a bit of an old Wall; ſo the hope of the natural heart that remains ſince the Fall, is but a bit of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Tower, it's not an houſe wherein a man can ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from challenges, from rain, ſtorm, and terrors; it's a ſupernatural grace, and Heathens they can have no hope of ſalvation, but ſome relicts of the old Wall, that ſays, once there was a Houſe there. Next, it is a ſupernatural grace wrought by God, all the Angels and Miniſters could not work this grace of hope, therefore if ye find a perſon tending to deſpair, all the Miniſters ye can bring to them, cannot bring them to his hope of ſalvation till God work it. 3. It's a ſupernatural grace, wrought in the heart of a Believer, the perſon muſt be firſt a Believer, before he can have the hope
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43047:148"/>of ſalvation. 4. The object of it is, ſome good not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, for hope that is ſeen is no hope; ſo if ye would ſee what this hope of ſalvation is, that is ſo great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in affliction, and at death, it's a ſupernatural grace, wrought by God in the heart of a believer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. There is only one practical Queſtion, to make way for the application that I ſhall clear, and it's this; Have all believers this hope of ſalvation in their end, to encourage them with? <hi>David</hi> had it indeed, but have all believers, and all that are in Covenant with God, have they this hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? The rather this difficulty is to be noticed, in regard, 1. The Lord ſometimes will bring ſome to their laſt words very deſpondent, full of fears; there are many, their firſt aſſurance hath been, the ſetting their foot on the Shore; and many have gone in to glory, and the tear in their eye, with the fear of the pit; have they all then this hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to be their encouragement at their laſt words?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will Anſwer this in theſe three or four particulars. 1. All believers have grounds of the hope of Salvation, they are all within the Covenant, they have the purpoſe of God, the promiſe of God, and the purchaſe of Chriſt; it's true, their Evidences may be out of ſight, and ſo dark, that they cannot read them in the night, and readily the tear may be in their eye, and they cannot ſee to read their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; yet generally, all the Elect and Believedrs, they have, as leamed men obſerve, this hope of Salvation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in promiſſo, in decreto, or in ſemine,</hi> they have a ground to hope for Salvation, and ye muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe two, the actual hope, and the ground of hope, it's true, the very unbelievers, and ungodly men, have a poſſibility of hope, which is a great mercy, there is hope for a living man, the Devils and Apoſtat Angels, would buy this poſſibility of hope at a dear rate, but they are excluded from a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of hope; but the Elect they have a poſſibility of hope, either <hi>in promiſſo, in decreto,</hi> or <hi>in ſemine,</hi> they have the actual ground of hope, though readily the exerciſe of their hope be ſlow. 2. Though God deny to ſome the aſſurance of hope, yet ordinarily he gives the full aſſurance of it, then it's a Queſtion among Divinges, what is the reaſon that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have gone doubting all their days, that when they have come to die, have had more peace, more joy, more
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43047:149"/>clearneſs, than before? They Anſwer, that God, who is the Steward of our peace, and of our joy, keeps it till then, and then he letteth it out. And 2. They, whom God denyes the full aſſurance of hope, they will be content of bare marks at death, and under affliction, they would not be content of it another time, and the marks they rejected when they were well, they are forced to take them then. And 3. He may deny it for good reaſons known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and they are eſpecially three, why even at the latter end of ſome, he will deny them the actual exerciſe of the hope of ſalvation. 1. To let them ſee, that he is Lord of his own Grace, and of is own time, to diſpoſe as he thinks fit; for if there were always a hope of Salvation, in the end we would think it due; though he give it ordinarily, yet he makes exceptions, to let us ſee, that he reſerves a latitude to himſelf, and will not fix nor determine a tine, for the communication of his influences. 2. There are ſome that die under ſome un-repented ſins, they may have gone through their whole lives, and may have heard many Sermons, and yet may be ſecure, and quiet, and hardned, though their Conſciences could tell them of ſome ſecret guilt, they have committed in their life, un-repented for; no wonder he give them a ſtorm in the mouth of the Harbour, not to take away their hope, but to let them ſee, that he is Lord of his own Grace, and of his own Time. Mr. <hi>Sibs</hi> Obſerves, that they have had manyeſt terrours in their end, that had feweſt in their life, a perſon that goes under a quiet peaceable way of Religion all their life time, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the beginning, nor progreſs of it, hath had many Terrours, will have a Storm in the End; though he ſecure their Salvation, yet he may deny the ſtrong actual exerciſe of the hope of Salvation, all their Life-time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though the Lord deny the Joy, or Aſſurance of the hope of Salvation, as there is Joy and Aſſurance of the hope of Salvation, evidenced in Scripture, yet there is in all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, a ſecret innitency of hope, as there is a ſecret rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith, ſo there is a ſecret innitency in hope, I have been witneſs to ſome, that at Death bed bould be brought to no hope of Salvation, and when they were bidden quite and renunce and deſpair of the hope of Salvation, no, they durſt do nothing of that kind, which evidences, there was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:43047:149"/>ſome ſecret act of inn itency on Chriſt, and hoping for the thing promiſed, though there was not the actual exerciſe of it. So in Anſwer to the Queſtion, ye have all theſe four, Firſt, That all men have a poſſibility of hope, that the Devils, and Apoſtat Angels cannot have. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have always the grounds of hope, either in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, the Promiſe, or in the Seed. Thirdly, If the Lord deny them the actual exerciſe of hope, it is either to chaſtiſe them, for ſome Un-repented guilt, or for tryal, to let them ſee that he is Lord of his own coming and going, and not to limit him to a Time. Fourthly, to learn them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, betwixt a ſecret act of hope, ſo that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well call it hope himſelf yet it hath hope imported in it, and a real act of hope, that is ſtrong, lively and in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; ſo that generally the point holds, that Believers in their latter end have the hope of Salvation, and this hope is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial cordial to patience, and longing for Glory, and to all to all that I have formerly ſpoken of.</p>

I exhort you to get this Hope, ye that want it.</p>
            <p>But ye will aſk, how ye ſhall come at it? For helping you to it, I would offer you ſome conſiderations, and ſome Practices for helping you to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take notice of ſome Conſiderations, and I ſhall name theſe three, Firſt it may help you to this, that ye are under a poſſibility of this hope, hope is poſſible for you, it were a folly to preach among the Devils, or the damned in Hell to hope, for they are excluded from all poſſibility of hope, if they had ten thouſand worlds, and every one of them better than this World, they would give it all for hope, if it were but poſſible for them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o get it; but there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility for you, in a little ye will be beyond the poſſibility of it, if ye do it not now. 2. Conſider what a dreadful thing it is, to be without the hope of Salvation; the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Kints theſe two together, <hi>having no hope, and without God in the world;</hi> if ye be without hope, ye are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, and what have ye in your hand, if ye be without God; it's but a poor thing ye have in your own havd, ye have your little Cottage and your Dyet, and your cloathing, is that your all? if ye be without the hope of Salvation, ye have your all in your hand; what a dreadful thing is that, and what a poor man is he, that hath no more but what he hath in his own hand. 3. I exhort you to condſider to preſs you to get this hope of Salvation, that ye are tryſted with a toſſing time, a time of tryal, if we were without hope, ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> we were of all men moſt miſerable, what will be your cordial in all the trials and afflictions ye may meet with, if ye want the hope of ſalvation? I might add many moe to preſs you, to get this hope of Salvation, but if ye ponder theſe that I have given you, they may be of great weight.</p>
            <p>I would offer you four Practices, I that would ſecond theſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43047:150"/>Conſiderations with, to preſs you to get this hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 1. I exhort you to take heed of a counterfeit hope, <hi>The hope of the hypocrite, ſays</hi> Job, <hi>ſhall be like the giving up the Ghoſt,</hi> They gloſs it well, that ſay, <hi>The hope of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, ſhall go away, as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> Thue Faith and true Hope, had never greater enemies than the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of them; <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was a great Politician, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the worſhip of the true God at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> he will not keep them from all worſhip, but will ſet up in the place of one God, two calves, one at <hi>Dan,</hi> and another at <hi>Bethel;</hi> Some gloſs it, he will give them dayly work, if he ſet up a counterfeit hope; better have one true God, than two calves, and theere is nothing will hinder them more from the worſhip of the true God, than theſe two calves, therefore take heed of counterfeit hope; for Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers, will enter into the Kingdom of God, before proud <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and they that have counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit hope. 2 If ye would win at this hope of Salvation, I exhort in the ſecond place, to be more diligent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And we deſire, that every one of you, do ſhew the ſame dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> wherefore diligence? <hi>To the ſull aſſurance of hope unto the end;</hi> be not ſlothful or negligent, a perſon that would come to his Hope, would not only be ſerious, but diligent in his ſeriouſneſs; we muſt be both diligent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or elſe we cannot have a well grounded hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore if ye would be at this Salvation, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted <hi>David</hi> at his laſt words, take heed of a counterfeit hope, and be diligent and ſerious in it. 3. If thou would attain this hope of Salvation, thou who art without it, I exhort thee to be a ſerious ſtudent of the Covenant, the great ground of hope is from the Covenant, all that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from Chriſt, or mercy, is holden out in the Covenant; therefore a Chriſtian that would trow in this hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or would have it real, ſhould (like a Child) be lying at the Breaſts of the Covenant, and ſucking out of theſe Breaſts: Obſerve the Conditions of the Covenant, if thou underſtand not the Covenant, and ſuck not out of the Breaſts of the Covenant, thy hope is but a patched up hope, and like the hope of the Hypocrite, that hath only a Portraicture in the Soul, and not a living hope; ſtudy theſe things, if ye would be at a well grounded hope of Heaven. I know
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43047:151"/>there are many would be at a well grounded Hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they ſee they muſt die, and that their days will not ay laſt, and that it will not be the thoughts of creatures, that will determine, whether they be good or evil; if you would have a hope, that will ſtand through in that day, obſerve theſe things, conſider there is a poſſiblity of genting it, it may be it cloſe before this Winter be done, and conſider if ye have no hope, and be without God, ye have no cordial in affliction, and at death, in a little ye muſt divide all that ye have, and leave it behind you, and not take a frothy thing to the grave with you, and except ye retain a hope of ſalvation, ye take not ſo much as a ſheet to the grave with you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Another Uſe of this Doctrine, is this hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſo great a Cordial in affliction, and at death? I would from this encourage you that hath this hope, of all the places of Scripture ye may take up that morning and evening, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and 4. and ſing, <hi>

Suppoſe ye count on never ſo many Croſſes, if ye have hope of Salvation, he hath made up in one Jewel, all that he hath caſt down in all his diſpenſations to them; ye that have this hope, I exhort you to two things, firſt, to live an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this hope; ſecondly, I exhort you to ſtrengthen it; firſt, ye that have this hope, live anſwerable, many a time our hope and our way is knit together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. I will proſecute this Exhortation in anſwering this Queſtion, how a Chriſtian that is hoping for Heaven, lives anſwerable to his hope? for it is unſuitable for us, to profeſs the hope of glory, and live as we do, we ſpeak of our Countrey but ſeidom, and we ſpeak not as Travellers going home to their Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will anſwer this in theſe few particulars. 1. A Chriſtian lives up in ſome meaſure to his hope of Salvation, when he is careful to do nothing that will contradict his hope; if we be without faith, it's impoſſible to pleaſe God, and ſo without hope of Salvation; there is no prayer we
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43047:151"/>put up, but we ſhould examine, is there faith in it? we preach nothing, we hear nothing, we read nothing, but we ſhould examine, is there a myſtery of Faith in it? we ſhould do nothing but what may conſiſt with our hope; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reaſoned well, when he was bid flie into the Temple to ſave his Life, <hi>ſhall ſuch a man as I flee,</hi> ſays he? If a man wrong you, and ye find thoughts of revenge againſt him, and will not forgive him, ye contradict your hope; have ye the hope of the forgivance of a Debt of a thouſand talents, and wilt thou ſtand with thy fellow ſervant, for the Debt of an hundred talents? if ye have the hope to walk with him in white, and to have all the guilt of your heart, and your way waſhenin the blood of the Lamb, and will ye ſtand at a Triffle, that expects the removal of a mountain? 2. Poſitively, one comes up to the hope of Salvation, in the practice of theſe four things. 1. We walk like our hope, when we keep company in the world like our hope, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs we are ſtrangers in this world, and hopes in a little to be at home, in leſs than threeſcore and ten years, and yet we keep not company like our hope; it's a remarkable word of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, Heb. 11.9. <hi>By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange countrey, dwelling in tabernacles with Iſaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the ſame promiſe; Abraham</hi> kept within doors, and whom had he to converſe with? He had <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> heirs of the ſame Promiſe, Travellers in a far Countrey, upon the account they are countrey men, and minds to be at home, they travel, they converſe, and traffick together, and can thou have hope to be in Heaven, and not walk ſuitable to thy hope here? if a Perſon given to error or profanity, be the perſon with whom thy converſe is moſt, and yet hopes to be in the land, where there is neither error nor profanity, thy walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts thy hope. 2. As thou would walk like thy hope in thy company, ſo I would exhort thee, to walk like thy hope in the ſtrain and height of thy way; why art thou not more ſpiritual in thy converſe in the world? O! how ſtrange is it for me to profeſs, I take communion with God, for my chief happineſs, and hopes for an eternity of it, and yet can be content with ſo little of him here; if thou hope to have an eternal communion with him, can thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to hear a Sermon, without communion with him? can
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43047:152"/>thou go to a Corner and be content, without communion with him? when thou walks contrair to this, thou walks not ſuitable to thy hope? if thou have the hope of Salavation, thy ſecret converſe with God, and when thou comes to have publick Ordinances, they will all keep up a ſuitableneſs to thy hope, otherwiſe thy hope is falſe. 3. If thou would walk like thy hope, manifeſt it in thy contempt of the world; the hope of Glory, ought to fill thy heart with contempt of the World: I ſuppoſe any ſaw a man that had a great eſtate, and had many Farms coming in, and a great many fields of Corn, if ye ſaw him gatering heads of Corn after the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, among the Beggers, would ye not undervalue his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and think he walked very unſuitable to what God had given him? The truth is, when Believers are vexed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the world, conſtantly having their Joy and their Sorrow, Ebbing and Flowing, as the World Ebbs and Flows with them, they walk not like their hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: I like the Obſervation of a great Man, he ſays, in all the Bible it's never found, that a truly godly man was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous; and is it not a ſtrange thing, that now it ſhould be the notted ſin-of Profeſſors? they were guilty of many groſs ſins, but they were never guilty of that, and they that have the hope of Salvation, expecting to wear a Crown, and to ſee him as he is, and to carry Palms in their hands, and does not manifeſt their contempt of the World, they are like a man, having a great Eſtate, and yet found among the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, gathering after the Reapers. 4. If ye would walk ſuitable to your hope, then ye would manifeſt it in affliction and death, thus <hi>David</hi> did here, the laſt words of the Son of <hi>Jeſſe;</hi> I have read it in the <hi>Turks Hiſtory,</hi> they ſay a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cannot be ſerions in believing, that there is ſuch Joys after Death, as the Chriſtians profeſs, the reaſon is, ſay they, they are ſo unwilling to die; great fears of death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences ſmall hopes of Heaven. 5. If ye would walk ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your hope, it would be manifeſted in your care to get theſe hopes; Why do we preſs you to imbrace the Covenant, and hearken unto the offers of Salvation, but that ye may come to have that hope of Salvation ye look for?</p>
            <p>I exhort you in the ſecond place, to labour to ſtrengthen your hope; <hi>Wherefore the rather brethren, we exhort you, to give all diligence, to the full aſsurance of hope;</hi> reſt not upon
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43047:152"/>a general of hope, unleſs ye get the full aſſurance of it; I will not ſay, the want of aſſurance of Heaven is a ſin, but the want of diligence to get aſſurance is a ſin, God may delay aſſurance of Heaven for Tryal, or for Chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Ye may aſk, How ſhall we come by the ſtrengthning of our hope?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will offer you three Rules to ſtrengthen your hope, and I beſeech you to ponder them. 1. Chriſtian, if thou would have ſtrong hope of Heaven, labour to get a ſtrong love to Chriſt, the thing that ſhakes our hope to Heaven is Fear, and perfect Love caſts out Fear. 2. I exhort thee, to be frequent in exerciſing thy hope of Heaven, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing gathers a habit by oft acting it, ought it not to be fear that ſhould be putting a perſon to abſtain from ſin, or to be comforted againſt the difficulties of the time? If a Chriſtian meet with Temptations to Sin, if he be under fear of Hell for it, I will go to Hell, if I do this, it is not the way to ſtrengthen hope; but when we are encouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der difficulties, from the hope of Glory, that in a little, we will be above difficulties, it is the ready way to ſtrengthen hope. 3. If ye would have your hope of Heaven ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made ſure, obſerve your experiences ye have of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Patience worketh experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hope, and hope makes not aſhamed;</hi> it's true, the great ground of our hope, ye will find it in the Covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve well your experiences ye have of God, and of his Word. I would give to Chriſtians three Rules, in their obſerving experiences of God. 1. Know, that one may have experience of God, and not know that they have it, in the time they have it, there may be a real experience of God, a gracious experience, and yet in the time a perſon hath it, they may not know they have it; let but any take the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe betwixt Chriſt, and the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> all the time that Chriſt is with them, they know him not, and they ſpeak out much unbelief, <hi>We thought this ſhould have been he, which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,</hi> and on the matter, they ſaid, they are beguiled; and yet after he is away, they ſaid, <hi>Did not our heart burn within us?</hi> They obſerved not the burning of the heart in the time, but after he is away, their heart burns: Many have ſweet experiences of Chriſt, that think not much of them in the time, but
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43047:153"/>after they are away, they would give their hearts blood to have them again; there may be a very real experience of God given, and yet in the mean time, not take it for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious experience. 2. I would have the Chriſtian know, to keep up their hope by experiences of God, that experiences will ſometimes be altogether out of ſight; ſo that thou can neither ſee them in the time, nor after they are gone, I like the advice I have ſometimes given a Chriſtian in that caſe, in keeping up his hope of Heaven, is not to caſt away hope, when all experiences are out of ſight, but there are two things to keep up hope, when experiences are cut of ſight. 1. Take up ſhelter under the abſolute Promiſes, ay when we are dung from our Evidences and Marks, we ſhould not ſit down and deſpair, but go to the abſolute Promiſes, ſuch as, <hi>I will take away the heart of stone, I will ſprinkle clean wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon them,</hi> &amp;c. And there may be hope there. 2. When experiences are away, it's a Chriſtians duty to ſeek a new Extract of them again, like a man that hath payed ſome Debt, and he hath gotten a Diſcharge of it, but he hath loſt it, and he is charged for the Sum again, and he goes to the Regiſter, and takes out a new Extract; So thou art not to caſt away all hope, but to go to him for a new Experience, and readily that will be an Extract of the true Diſcharge, and be as valid in Law, as the Diſcharge thou haſt loſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord your Experiences of God, and when ye want them, ye are not to caſt away your hope of Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. The third Uſe, Is the hope of Salvation ſo ſweet, and ſo neceſſary, it ſerves for Tryal; try of what Mettal ye and made of, I believe there are none ſitting here, but they are all filled with the hope of Salvation, your hope will make many of you aſhamed, and your Hell may be hotter, than ye had not hoped for Heaven. I will only leave this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the hoping of Salvation, with giving theſe three Marks, whereby ye may try, if your hope be a Helmet, as the Apoſtle calls it (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17.) of Salvation, of the right Mettal, or only a Counter. 1. The hope of Salvation that is right, we are begotten to it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſt be the Lord, who hath begotten us again to a lively hope, to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> &amp;c. It's not a hope of our making, to which in Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Calling we are begotten; if thou cannot prove thy Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling, and thy Regeneration, and that thou art born
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43047:153"/>again, and in Effectual Calling begotten, all thy progreſs, all thy diligence, and all thy parts, will not prove it a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope; therefore examine your Effectual Calling, if ye were begotten again by the Goſpel, otherways your hope ſhall periſh with you. 2. The hope of Salvation, which is of the right ſtamp, carries along with it Mortification, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.9. <hi>Purifying your hearts by faith:</hi> we have hearts within us, like ſtables, that would be often muched; there is a Dung hill within, that Pride, and that Paſſion of thine, if ye have the lively hope of the Inheritance, ye will be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ye will be ſweeping the Houſe every day; what are ye carrying every day out of the heart? there are many that have great hope of Salvation, and if they were dying they would tell many ſtories that they had of marks of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but if ye be not purifying your ſelf, and obſerving what of corruption ye are carrying out, and what degrees of corruption ye have gotten the victory over, and if there be not this, your hope is not right. A third Mark ye have, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Christ in you, the hope of glory;</hi> What account can ye give of Chriſt dwelling in you? Where he dwells, he dwells as a King, as a Refiner, as a Counſellor, as a Comforter, as a Leader, as a Guide; He is holden out in all theſe reſpects in the Covenant, it's no, if ye have Parts, if ye have Gifts in you, but what account can ye give of his dwelling in you? uſes he to ſup with you, and ye with him? walks he in you? he hath Promiſed, <hi>I will walk in them, and dwell in them, and be their God;</hi> when ye meet with Temptations, ye will talk of the hope of Glory, but is Chriſt dwelling in you, the hope of glory? Laſtly, This hope of Salvation, it both flows from diligence, and is accompanied with diligence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, and 12. <hi>And we deſire, that every of you ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſsurance of hope to the end, that ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes;</hi> thou haſt a great hope, and a ſlothful converſation; I have often wondered to ſee, how careleſs a way, and ſo great hope, do we talk of ſo great a hope, and think we have no more ado, but gather heads among the Stuff, and live as the Begger? Now, put your ſelf to the Tryal in all theſe four, and if it want theſe four, it will be a hope, that will be like the giving up of the Ghoſt, and will leave you in the day of your diſtreſs.</p>

                  <p>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>AFter <hi>David</hi> hath ſpoken of the nature of the Security, that it was by way of Covenant, and after he hath ſpoken of the Properties, he mentions the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuperſtructures he builds on the Covenant, they are two, <hi>This is all my ſalvation, and al my deſire.</hi> The firſt fo them, I have ſpoken unto, and ſhewed you, how the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was all the hope of Salvation, that a Believer had; Gods Mercy, and Chriſts Righteouſneſs, Abſtract them from the Covenant, it might as well be pleaded by Devils as Men, the thing that makes us have the hope of Salvation from them, and not the Apoſtat Angels, is the Covenant.</p>
            <p>But I come now to the ſecond Superſtructure and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, he hath from this well ordered Covenant, <hi>it's all my deſire;</hi> it is not eaſie to ſatisfie all deſires, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires run very wide, but this is all my deſire; Two things are neceſſary for clearing this to you. 1. How the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant can be called our deſire? ſome gloſs it thus, the act is put, ſay they, for the object, the deſire is an act of the will, and ſometimes a diſtinct affection from the will, the <hi>velle,</hi> or that which is the proper act of them Will, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and how can the Covenant be called, <hi>this is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire?</hi> Therefore ſome gloſs it thus, <hi>all the object of my deſire,</hi> the deſire is put for the thing deſired; or as others will have it, <hi>This is ſatisſaction to all my deſires,</hi> or, <hi>the thing that ſatisfies all my deſires,</hi> and all my deſire is, that God hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there is a great difficulty behind, How can the Covenant be called ſatisfaction to all our deſires? have we not many irregular deſires, and can it be called ſatisfaction to all our deſires? Therefore the meaning muſt be, all my lawful or regular
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:43047:154"/>deſires, the Covenant ſatisfies all that I can lawfully deſire. Now deſires may become irregular, and unlawful two ways. 1. When we deſire things unlawful, covetous and laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſires, the Covenant ſatisfies them not at all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemns them. 2. Deſires may terminat on lawful objects, in an irregular way, and the Covenant ſatisfies them not, a perſon may have deſires after the Covenant, and yet theſe deſires may prove very irregular.</p>
            <p>There are three kinds of deſires about the Covenant it ſelf, and all theſe may be irregular deſires. 1. Sometimes we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the bleſſings of the Covenant, without a right to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; as if one would deſire the fruit of an Apple-tree, without a right to the Tree. 2. And ſometimes we deſire the bleſſings of the Covenant, and forgets the commands. 3. And ſometimes we may deſire the promiſes of peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, without the promiſes of Effectual Calling; theſe deſires terminat on lawful objects, but they are irregular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the Covenant will not ſatisfie them; but all our regular deſires, all that are warrantable and according to the Covenant, there is in the Covenant ſatisfaction to them all; the perſon that hath a Covenant-relation to God, they have in that relation, ſatisfaction to all their deſires.</p>
            <p>Withoutinſiſting further in clearing the words, I will take one Obſervation, and readily follow it in three or four Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for it is a great truth, and as important a truth, as any that hath yet occurred in this Verſe, and the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be this;</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>That the Covenant is ſatisfaction to all our deſires:</hi> if God hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, it's that which may ſatisfie all my deſires; it's true, it will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our irregular and unwarrantable deſires, it will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie covetous and laſcivious deſires: I remember I read of a man, who came to a Philoſopher, O ſaith he he is a happy man that hath all his deſires; the Philoſopher anſwered, he is a happy man, but a far happier man, that deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he ought to deſire; ſo, if we deſire nothing but what we ought to deſire, the Covenant will ſatisfie all our deſires. This ſhall be the Theme that I reſolve to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a little, that an intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant, is ſatisfaction to all our lawful deſires. It will be a great work to convince you of this, but I hope to make it appear from
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43047:155"/>very rational grounds, and ſo let you ſee, that the torment we have in our life, it's not from want of grounds of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our deſires, but from the irregularity of our deſires, we go in our deſires beyond what we ought.</p>
            <p>That the Covenant affords ground of ſatisfaction to all our deſires, before I prove it, I muſt give you this Caution as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory to it: Satisfaction of deſires conſiſts in two things, 1. The object that ſatisfies muſt be adequat and full, it muſt be as comprehenſive as the deſires are large, other ways it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie; it is very obſervable that School-men teach, that in glory, if there were one deſire unſatisfied, it would be a degree of miſery, he that hath an appetite, and hath his deſire unſatisfied, is in ſo far miſerable; and if there were one deſire, and one thing in our appetite not ſatisfied, it would be a degree of miſery; ſo, what is ſatisfying to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, muſt be adequat and fully proportioned to the deſire. 2. As it muſt be a full, ſo it muſt be ſuitable ſatisfaction, as ſome deſcribe it, it conſiſts in a ſuitableneſs of the object to the faculty; ſo that if ye aſk, what is that which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the deſires of the ſoul? It's a full object, and an object ſuitable to all the faculties in the ſoul; ſo when we ſay, the Covenant ſatisfies all our deſires, there are two things we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſt inſtruct to you, that the Covenant is full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of all the good we can deſire, and that theſe good things are ſuitable to our deſire: theſe two I will labour to make out in this Sermon, that I may prove that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſatisfaction to all our deſires, I ſhall firſt prove it to be full and adequat, and then prove it to be ſuitable, and conſequently prove it full ſatisfaction to all our deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Covenant is full, abundantly adequat and comprehenſive of all the things we can warrantable deſire: for clearing of this, I will offer you firſt ſome general proofs of it, and ſecondly ſome particular and ſpecial proofs of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will offer you ſome general proofs of it, and by way of Introduction to them, I will give you this in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>That God in the Covenant reſolved to lay himſelf out to the outmoſt, Mat.</hi> 22. the Goſpel-offers in the Covenant, are like to a certain King, that made a Marriage-feaſt, at the Marriage of his only Son; a King making a Feaſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Marriage-feaſt at the Marriage of his only Son, thou may be ſure he would lay himſelf out to the outmoſt at that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:43047:155"/>Feaſt; ſo the Lord hath laid himſelf out to the outmoſt in the Covenant: This being generally premiſed, it may make you expect, that it will not be difficult to prove, that the Covenant contains ſatisfaction to all our deſires.</p>
            <p>And I will offer you theſe four general proofs of it, 1. The Covenant contains all the excellencies that are to be found in the Creatures; ordinarily our deſires they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulat by our ſenſes, like <hi>Eva</hi> we ſee the Apple, and we have an appetite after it, according as we ſee, our appetite and our deſires, are regulat by hearing and ſeeing; there is nothing excellent that ever we heard of, or ſaw, but it's contained in the Covenant; take a view of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ye will find in it the promiſes of a Kingdom; nay more, of Bread, Wine, Milk, Honey, Myrrhe, Spices; ye will find alſo in the Covenant, promiſes of Fountains, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Beds of Roſes, ye will find Gold, Linen, Eye-ſalve: there are ſome Divines have taken pains in ſome of their Books, to gather all the ſimilitudes together, and they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there is nothing excellent in the Creature, but it's promiſed in the Covenant; if a man have a deſire after Gold, and fine Gold, if he have a deſire after Linen, and fine Linen, after Bread, Wine, Spices, Beauty, ye will find one, who is white and ruddy, hath promiſed all theſe in the Covenant; what ever it be that a man hath an appetite after, ye will find it in the Covenant; and ſince the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contains all theſe things that are excellent among the Creatures, is it any wonder that it ſatisfie all deſires? all pleaſure, profit, honour, or whatever the appetite can be carried after, is promiſed in the Covenant; and which is remarkable, Gold, Bread, Wine, fine Linen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are but ſhadows that are to be found among the Creatures, the ſubſtance is only to be found in the Covenant: It's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fine Gold, to diſtinguiſh it from Gold in the earth, it's called fine Linen, for all other Linens are but black in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this; it's called Eye-ſalve, for Salves may be Salves to our finger when it is cut, but it's much to make up Eye-ſalve; all excellencies in the Creature, are only to be found in the Creature in the Shell, and are to be found in the Covenant in the Kernel. 2. All that is in glory, and all that is in Heaven, are contained in the Covenant: The Prophet tells us <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.4. <hi>Since the beginning of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43047:156"/>would men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</hi> It is a ſtrange deſcription given of Heaven in Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.10. <hi>It's called a City, and a great City,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>The wall of it hath twelve gates,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>It hath twelve foundations,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>The foundations of the wall of the City, are garniſhed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>The ſtreets of the City are of pure gold,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. and 23. <hi>There is no Temple there, and there is no need of the Sun there, for the Lamb is the Temple of it, and the Sun is the light of it;</hi> now, ear hath not heard, nor eye hath not ſeen a City like that which is deſcribed there, and the Covenant holds out all theſe; therefore ſome have well obſerved on this Text, that the Covenant not only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies all our deſires, but it contains ſomething more than our deſires, our deſires would never have reached the longing after ſuch a City, that had ſuch gates, and ſuch foundations, and ſtreets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Covenant muſt contain ſatisfaction to all our deſires, for all the excellencies in the Creature, and all the excellencies of glory, are promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 3. The Covenant muſt ſatisfie all our deſires, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it holds out to us what ever is in God; his infinit At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, his Mercy, his Goodneſs, his Truth, his Power, all theſe are made over to us in the Covenant; there is more in God than we can deſire, nay, there is ſomething in God; that it is impoſſible for our wit to reach: It's remarkable <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31. Chriſt proves againſt the Sadducees the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead, from that word he ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> at the burning Buſh, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living:</hi> all the Philoſophers on earth, could never have drawn that conſequence out of that word; would not any have thought it ſo remote a proof of the reſurrection, that no Phyſician, no Philoſopher, nor no Juriſt could have drawn ſuch a conſequence, unleſs Chriſt had done it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? There is ſomewhat in that word, <hi>my God, and I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. that will require Chriſt to explain it. Now, in the Covenant he hath made over himſelf to us, and all that he hath, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> this ſhall be my Covenant with you, <hi>I will be your God and ye ſhall be my people;</hi> and is not this ſatisfaction to all our deſires? But
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43047:156"/>4. to evidence this yet further, that there is a ſatisfaction to all our deſires, and a compleat ſatisfaction to all our regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſires in the Covenant, ye would take notice what I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, when firſt I entered on this Verſe; there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Covenant neceſſary, to make up compleat ſatisfaction and ſecurity to our deſires, and all the three kinds of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants concur in the Covenant of Grace: 1. There paſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men a Covenant of War, and a Covenant of Peace, they are bound by that Covenant in offenſive and defenſive Leagues, there is a mutual Peace betwixt them, and a mutual War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame enemies, they have the ſame friends and the ſame foes; this is a thing very neceſſary in ſatisfaction to our deſires, and this is in the Covenant of Grace, there is a reconciliation, a peace made up, and all the Articles of it are very favourable and advantagious. 2. To make up ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our deſires, it is neceſſary betwixt Nations that enter in Covenant, that there be a Covenant of Commerce and Traffick, they will Import and Export Goods; ſo here, ſometimes he Imports the bleſſings of Heaven, and ſometimes he will Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port other Goods, not to wrong us, but to ſatisfie our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. 3. There is a marriage-Covenant; now what can be more deſirable, to ſatisfie our deſires, than theſe three? for the Covenant partakes of all theſe three, and what can be more required of God, to ſatisfie all our deſires? To be brief, the Covenant is holden out ſo, as it holds out things of infinit excellency, and our appetite being finit, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to have deſires ſuitable, and adequat to the Covenant; <hi>David</hi> had ſaid nothing but truth, if he had ſaid, the Covenant is ſatisfaction beyond my deſires. Now lay the four together, and ye will ſee, that ſince God was reſolved to lay himſelf out to the utmoſt, according to his own heart, to ſatisfie all our deſires, no wonder the Covenant ſatisfie our deſires, ſince it contains all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Creature, and all that is in Heaven, and all that is in God, and that there is made over and ſecured to us, not only a Covenant of Peace and War, and a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Traffick, but alſo a Marriage-Covenant, wherein our Maker becomes our Huſband. Theſe generals contribute ſomewhat to evidnce, that the Covenant may ſatisfie all our regular and warrantable deſires.</p>
            <p>I will follow the reſt with anſwering five or ſix Queſtions
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43047:157"/>that may occur about this, that the Covenant ſatisfies all our deſires, and they will contribute much to clear and confirm, that there is in this Covenant ſatisfaction to all our deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. It may be aſked, ſuppoſe the Covenant be full and ſuitable, yet it ſatisfies not all deſires, unleſs they have a right to that fulneſs; it's a very difficult thing to ſatis all deſires, a man proves not the Covenant to ſatisfie all deſires, that proves it to be full and ſuitable, but I have not a right to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer to this, this will be no Exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Covenants ſatisfying all deſires, if ye take notice of three things. 1. It's true indeed, it may be a very ordinary Caſe I confeſs, the Covenant is full and very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but my deſire is to have a Right and Satisfaction in the Covenant. In anſwer to the Queſtion, I ſay firſt, the Covenant it offers a Right, thou could deſire no more in the offer of a Right, than the Covenant holds forth, thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is ſatisfied to the full, thou art offered all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies in the Creature, and all that is in Heaven, and all that is in God, there is no leſs offered thee in the Covenant, thy deſires are ſatisfied to the full as to the offer, and as to the terms on which the Offer is made, there is no more required of thee in the Covenant, than to take all theſe and make them thine; no more but take and accept them, would thou have the Covenant made to thee, whether thou accept of the terms or not? So in the Covenant, thou has the offer of a right, on the eaſieſt terms our heart could imagine. 2. Thou that ſays, the Covenant anſwers not all my deſires, I would have thee to conſider in the ſecond place, all that get a right to the Covenant, the right to it is not of their buying or meriting, but it comes through the grace of the Covenant; ſo it may ſatisfie all thy deſires as to this, the Price of the Right is Payed in the Covenant, the offer of the Right is Payed in the Covenant, ſo thy Right to the Covenant comes through the grace of the Covenant, there is not only the offer of a Right, but the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Right, and even that communication of a Right, comes through the grace of the Covenant. 3. I would have thee that makes this exception, that thou has no Right to the Covenant, becauſe it anſwers not all thy deſires; do but accept of this Covenant, and imbrace Chriſt on the eaſieſt terms, and thou ſhalt find thy Right to the Covenant
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43047:157"/>confirmed by the Covenant; to be brief, thy deſire of a right to the Covenant may be ſatisfied, if thou will but add to thy deſires, the aceepting of the Covenant, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the offer; put forth thy trembling hand and take the Covenant, and thou ſhall find it ſatisfie thy deſires, as to thy right to the Covenant; ſo there is none can juſtly except, that the Covenant ſatisfies not all deſires, if they deſire a right to the Covenant; I tell thee again, if thou will but accept of and imbrace this Covenant, I make the offer to thee in his Name this day, take it, and it's thine. But to confirm it the better, I will offer thee two or three things, 1. If thy deſire be of a right to the Covenant, if thou accept of the offer, thy deſires ſhall be ſatisfied, notwithſtanding of all thy former guilt, if thou have a deſire of a right and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, though thou were a Murderer, a Whoremonger, a Perſecuter or a Blaſphemer, thou ſhalt have thy deſires ſatisfied; the Covenant excludes not thee, but rather it tells thee, though thou haſt played the Harlot with many Lovers, yet return unto me. 2. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will not ſtand at the weakneſs of thy faith, if thou be one that deſires a right to the Covenant, and if thou accept of it, though thou take it with a trembling hand, and with a palſie arm, though it be a trembling and ſhaking faith, if thou have a deſire to accept the Covenant, there is in the Covenant, that which will ſatisfie all thy deſires, though thy faith be but like a grain of muſtard ſeed, or a bruiſed reed, or a ſmoaking flax; if it be ſincere, it will ſatisfie thy deſires, if thou accept the Covenant. But 3. If thou accept the Covenant, it ſhall ſatisfie thy deſires, and ſatisfie thee, as to thy right of it, though thy faith be mingled with much corruption, ſuppoſe thou cannot ſay, I believe, yet ſay, I accept, and let the next word be, Lord, help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. 4. If thou will accept this Covenant, thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in thy deſires of a right to it, though thou have no price in thy hand to give; if thou have no money, yet thou may buy without money, it's God that ſells, and he ſells without money and without price; ſo thou cannot ſay, thou has no price to give for a right to it, the Covenant may ſatisfie thy deſires in that, for the price is payed in the Covenant; ſo I ſuppoſe, the firſt Objection is ſatisfied, for I have holden out the Covenant to be full, containing all that's in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43047:158"/>all that is in Heaven, and all that is in God; if thou ſhalt ſay, it ſatisfies not my deſires, I deſire a right to it, and cannot win at it, but as to the offer of a right, and accepting of the leaſt faith, for all former guilt, and a faith mingled with corruption, and a faith that cannot buy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no money, the Covenant diſpenſes with all theſe; therefore if thou be not ſatisfied in thy deſires of a Right, the fault it's not in the Covenant, but in thy ſelf, for thy deſires of a Right, comes not to be ſatisfied, but through the Covenat.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT muſt be an excellent thing that can ſatisfie all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; how vaſt are our deſires, and how unſatisfiable? would ye then know what it is that ſatisfies all our deſires, the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, and this is all my deſire? I was offering you ſome reaſons, why the Covenant ſatisfies all our deſires; I was entering to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſome Objections, that would contribute to clear it, I named one, two or three more I will name you, and then ſhall come to the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It may be objected in the firſt place, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can ſatisfie all our deſires, which being alone enjoyed is ſatisfactory; take a man in Priſon, in Poverty, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, will the Covenant alone ſatisfie him? have we not lawful deſires after Meat or after Apparel? and if theſe be nothing, can the Covenant ſatisfie all deſires: for Anſwer to this, ye ſhall notice three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all outward things, in ſo far as they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar (and we can only warrantably deſire them, in ſo far as they are neceſſar) are promiſed in the Covenant; it's a rare thing for one to die of hunger, thouſands die of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43047:158"/>Surfeit and Gluttony, where one dies of Hunger, and yet the Covenant ſatisfies their deſires are to neceſſaries. 2. Ye ſhall notice, ſuppoſe there were want of neceſſaries, yet it's accompliſhed and made up in other things, Gold will compenſe Braſs and Copper, he that hath God, and a Right to Heaven, will hardly complain of the want of Health; he corrected his word well that ſaid, there is nothing left me but God, and but God ſaid he, and what would I have more? 3. The Covenant alone it will ſatisfie all deſires, in regard it compenſes, and makes up any thing that we can deſire that is wanting; a remarkable inſtance ye have of this in the Bible, <hi>Jacob</hi> he got the Bleſſing, <hi>Eſau</hi> he got the fat of the earth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>Eſau</hi> cometh to meet <hi>Jacob</hi> with four hundred men, <hi>Jacob</hi> offereth him a preſent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. <hi>Eſau</hi> he refuſes to take it, I will not take it, ſays he, for I have enough, take it, my brother, ſays <hi>Jacob,</hi> for <hi>I have all;</hi> now, he had not the fat of the earth, if he would have counted his whole Stock, it would have but amounted to two Bands, but he had the bleſſing, God was become the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he had ſeen God in a Viſion at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and God had bleſt him, therefore he can ſay, take it my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for <hi>I have all;</hi> now he that hath all, hath ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all his deſires, ſo the Covenant alone, holding out Chriſt and the Father in our offer, is alone ſatisfying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Another Objection may be made againſt this, my heart deſires, ſays ſome, the poſſeſſion of the Promiſe, the accompliſhment of the Promiſe is not the Covenant, my heart would have the accompliſhment, I would have the Peace, the Joy, the Conſolation that is promiſed, and I would be at the Heaven promiſed; now how can the Covenant ſatisfie all deſires? it contains excellent promiſes indeed, but it contains not the Peace, the Heaven and the Joy promiſed, and how then can it ſatisfie all my deſires?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For opening this to you, I deſire ye may take notice of three things. 1. Ye muſt take notice, that there is a twofold Inheritance, or a twofold Poſſeſſion; there is a poſſeſſion of the Promiſe, and a poſſeſſion of the thing promiſed; ſeveral times Believers are called in the Bible, Heirs of the promiſe, was ever a man called an Heir of the Charter, he may be called Heir of the Land that the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carries; but the Believer may be called an Heir of the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43047:159"/>promiſe, the reaſon is, becauſe the Promiſe is a great part of the Inheritance, a perſon in Covenant with God, is an Heir of the Promiſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are called; ſo that there is an Inheritance of the Promiſe, as well as in the thing promiſed; a very neceſſary thing to be obſerved, for there are many precious to God who think, if they were in Heaven, and if they enjoyed the glory that is to be had there, they would count themſelves as Heirs; but while thou haſt a Promiſe, thou art poſſeſſing an Inheritance, for the Covenant it ſelf is a kind of poſſeſſion; thou that ſays, thou would be poſſeſt in the promiſe, and it's no words, and a Covenant thou would be put off with, thou miſtakes, for the Covenant and the Promiſe is an Inheritance, and thou art no Minor in the caſe, but art poſſeſſing as a Major.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take notice ye that would be at the Poſſeſſion of the Promiſe, and that thinks all your deſires will not be ſatisfied until then, that the Covenant, though it put you not in the poſſeſſion of the promiſe, yet it makes the Poſſeſſion as ſure, as if it were in your hand; that which we have in a promiſe from God, It's even as ſure as if it were in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it's remarkable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.7. The Pſalm is entituled, a pſalm of <hi>David</hi> when he fled from <hi>Abſalom</hi> his ſon, <hi>Thou haſt ſmitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, thou haſt broken the teeth of the ungodly:</hi> how could they be broken, when he was flying from <hi>Abſalom?</hi> But <hi>David</hi> had a promiſe for it, and he counts it as ſure as if it were in his hand; it's true it's not ſo ſweet nor ſo refreſhing, as if it were in hand, but it's as ſure; ſo ye ſee, though the Covenant put us not in poſſeſſion of the promiſe, yet it holds forth that which is as ſure, as if it were in poſſeſſion. But the third thing I will give you, that will more fully anſwer the Queſtion, and remove the Objection; that the delay of the poſſeſſion of the promiſe, is no denyal of it, and to deſire the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the promiſe, except it be in the method of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is an irregular deſire; ye heard, that the Covenant ſatisfies all regular and warrantable deſires, but to deſire the poſſeſſion of a thing, before we have ſought for it, and done that for which we came into the world, is an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſire; ſo if thou ſay, I have a great deſire of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Peace, the Joy and the Heaven, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant holds forth, thou art irregular in thy deſire; would
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43047:159"/>thou be at the poſſeſſion before, thou haſt run the race? or would thou be at the Crown, before thou haſt foughten the battel? that is an irregular deſire, and the Covenant is not to ſatisfie theſe deſires, the Covenant poſſeſſes thee in the promiſe, and that's an Inheritance, and makes it as ſure, as if it were in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. There are lawful deſires of the Creatures, and of eſchewing the Croſs, and the Covenant ſatisfies them not; may we not warrantably deſire convenient Food, many ſeek no more from God, and gets it not: they may have hundreds of Temptations about their Food, and how to eſchew the croſs, and doeth the Covenant ſatisfie all their deſires? For anſwer to this, I would have you notice theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Take notice, that we may deſire indeed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful convenient Food, and it may be denyed, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Croſs, and it may be denyed; but in this caſe, the Lord ſatisfies the deſire of our neceſſity, however he ſatisfies not our appetite, he may ſatisfie the cry of our need; if he ſhall kill us with Hunger, why not? if Famine be the Poſt to bring us home to our Fathers houſe, why not as well as a Fever? Whatever be the way he bring us home, he ſatisfies the ſcope of our deſires, the ſcope of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to him for temporal things, if they be lawful, they run in this Channel, that he would give us the things of time, in ſubordination to the things of Eternity, if we ſeek them otherways, we ſeek them irregularly, we ſeek Bread and Cloaths to help us to Heaven, but if he make Famine, and Nakedneſs to help us to Heaven, he ſatisfies our deſires; ſometime we will go to God, and cry, Lord, give me this outward Mercy, and remove this Croſs, for that will be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for my Heaven, if he deny the Mercy, and keep on the Rod, and yet help thee to Heaven, he ſatisfies thy deſire; as if a Patient ſhould cry to a Phyſician, O! I am burning in a Fever, give me water to drink; but he makes a Cordial and gives him to cool him, he grants his deſire, though he give not water to drink; ſo in affliction we cry, Lord, remove this affliction, and help me to Heaven; he lets the affliction ly on, and helps thee to Heaven, does he not grant thy deſire? we are ill carvers of our own Lot, our deſires about temporal things may be granted, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way and manner of it may be removed, he takes one
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43047:160"/>way for the end, and we would take another; we cry to be brought to Heaven in a Chariot, and he thinks ſit we ſhould be brought in a Cart, we would be at glory with a fair wind, and he thinks fit in a croſs wind; but if we come to glory, as well with a croſs wind, as a fair wind, the deſire is granted. Another thing I would have you conſider, is this, Though we deſire temporal things, and get no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, yet the Covenant may ſatisfie our deſires, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, it's rare to find us regular in temporal things; ſuch a Woman would have her Huſband living, and ſhe would quite God many other things, if he would not remove the delight of her eyes; another does ſo with her Child, and yet they both die, notwithſtanding God makes it up, and he grants their deſire, they think they cannot have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the World but in ſuch a Lot, they have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and drowned all their contentment, if that be taken away; the caſe is ſo with <hi>David,</hi> there is a Child <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> bare in Adultery, the Child falls ſick and dies, he lyes on the ground, while the Child is lying ſick, and will not eat all that time, after he hath cryed to the Lord, the Child dies, was it not much better, the ſame Woman bore him a <hi>Solomon,</hi> than that the Child begotten in Adultery ſhould live; to be brief, there is hardly any Objection can be brought from a Chriſtians caſe, or from their worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but they may be all abundantly anſwered from this, that the Covenant is ſatisfaction to all our deſires.</p>
            <p>I would ſpeak a little to the Application and Practical part of the Point, in regard it's a thing of great Importance, I reſolve to fall from this Branch of the Verſe, and therefore will apply it, ſuppoſing that I have proven it abundantly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. And I will apply it in three or four <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes, Firſt,</hi> Is the Covenant ſatisfaction to all our deſires? Then it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms of three or four things. 1. It informs of what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing the Covenant muſt be, Riches may ſatisfie the Covetous, and Honour may ſatisfie the Ambitious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and Whoredom may ſatisfie the Laſcivious; but what a thing is there that will ſatisfie all deſires? that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanerly to be found in God, and in the Covenant, ye that would have the thing in one Jewel, that the generality of men are ſeeking in many pieces of Copper Coin, get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, and it will ſatisfie all your deſires;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43047:160"/>O! but it muſt be an excellent Jewel, that will pay off all your Debt. 2. It informs what is the reaſon, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have ſuch a deal of quietneſs, even in the worſt of caſes, let them be in Priſon, let them be in a Fever, in Reproach, or in Poverty, yet they have a great deal of ſweet quietneſs; I will tell you, they have all their deſires ſatisfied in the Covenant, they deſire no more; and a man that hath all his deſires, in what condition ſoever he be, he is quiet; the great ground of our diſquieting is, we want ſomething we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but a Believer that can ſay, he hath made with me a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he hath Bread, Apparel, Wine, Milk, Gold, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Kingdoms, Cities, and he hath them all in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; therefore no wonder, if men labour to take their quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from them, if devils labour to take their quietneſs from them, yet they have ſtill a great deal of quietneſs, for they have all their deſires, and they are all contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 3. It informs of a third thing, of what is the reaſon of all the exerciſe of Conſcience, and diſquietings, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have; would ye know what it is, there is one thing that is all their deſires, which is their ſecurity in the Covenant: now, no wonder, when they are croſt in that which is all their deſire, to ſee them hanging down their head, and the ſeeble knees ſmiting one another, for when they are croſt in their intereſt in the Covenant, they are not croſt in a trifflle, but in that which is all their deſire; ſo ye may ſee the reaſon of their peace, and their trouble, (one thing have they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Lord, as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.) And as one thing goes ill or well, accordingly have they peace or not. 4. Is the Covenant all their deſire? it informs of what a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Spirit of Believers, and the Spirit of the Ungodly are; there are many they never care for the Covenant, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſay, who will give us Corn and Wine, and many hunt after their luſts; it's a wonder to ſee the great odds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the deſire of Believers and ungodly men, even as great odds as betwixt Eaſt and Weſt, all their deſires are ſatisfied, if they can ſay, <hi>God hath made with me an Covenant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath made over himſelf, and his Son, and all that he hath; hardly will there a Croſs come, that will ly heavy on, no wonder, for they have all their deſires, and a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not count himſelf croſt, that hath all his deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, for Uſe, is the Covenant all the deſires
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43047:161"/>of the Believer: Then I would exhort you to make it all your deſire, O! we are plagued ſometimes with Laſcivious, Earthly and Frothy Deſires, how excellently did the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Socrates</hi> anſwer the man that came to him, and ſaid, O! ſays he, he is a happy man that hath all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but ſays he, he is a happier man that deſires nothing, but what he may lawfully deſire? labour to get your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires regular according to the Covenant, that theſe may be nothing in your deſires, but what is contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. I would preſs this with ſeveral Motives and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, O! but the perſon is come to a noble Lot in his way to Glory, that hath his deſires regulat, according to the Covenant, whether they be deſires for the Church of God, or for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Readily ye may aſk, How ſhall we get our deſires regulat according to the Covenant? I will offer you two remarkable helps, and two Motives, to get you deſires regulat according to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, for helps to get your deſires regulat accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant, take theſe four things. 1. I would exhort you to ſtudy the Covenant, it will be an excellent help, to get your deſires regulat according to the Covenant, if ye be acquaint with it; the Covenant ſhould be the glaſs ye ſhould be looking into, and bringing your deſires to it, and the Covenant, like a face in the glaſs, ſhould reſemble one another; believe it, Chriſtian, who minds to come to Heaven, there is nothing thou needs, either for thy being or thy well-being, but it's contained in the Covenant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a ſtudent of it, and be well acquaint with it, it holds forth the things of Time, and things of Eternity, all the excellencies of God, all that is communicable to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are in the Covenant; therefore, if thou would have thy deſires regulat according to the Covenant, be a ſtudent of the Covenant. A ſecond Direction is, conſider ſeriouſly, there is nothing thou can deſire in Faith, except it be a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mercy, and contained in the Covenant; we have a great Queſtion with the Patrons of Liturgie, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book; ſome Divines write againſt it, ſay they, there are many Prayers in it, for things not promiſed, and we can only pray in Faith, for what is promiſed; we can warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably pray for nothing, but a promiſed mercy, for Faith is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43047:161"/>always founded on the Promiſe; ſo it is objected, if the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er go beyond it's Object, it's a prayer of the Service-Book, and I believe ſome pray in paſſion againſt their neighbour, and they pray for themſelves ignorantly, as their Opinion leads them; but if it be not a prayer within the Covenant, it will do no good, for Faith is a believing in the Promiſe, and if thou prays not in Faith, thou prays in ſin: ſo this may be a preſſing conſideration, that our prayers will never be heard, though it be preſented with as many Tears as there are Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Ocean, if it be not according to the Covenant. A <hi>3d.</hi> Direction, endeavour a work of Mortification in thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, unleſs thy deſires be mortified, they will go beyond the bounds of the Covenant; therefore in Effectual Calling, there is eſpecially intended by the Spirit of God, the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our deſires, we are not to deſire as Chriſt ſaid to the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children, <hi>Ye deſire,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye know not what,</hi> ſhe deſired one of her Sons to ſit upon his right hand, and the other on his left; ſhe would fain have the perſons great that ſhe loved; were we mortifying our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we would have another kind of life of it in the world, than we have, the thing that torments us in the world, we have a deſire after this and that, and the third thing, and are tormented becauſe our deſires are not accompliſhed; but were there a mortification of our deſires, and a bringing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant, we might have a ſweet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life in the world, beyond what we have; I heard a paſſage of an Old Man, here am I, ſays he, that in my life deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what I got, and I wanted nothing of what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, if we could get our deſires regulat according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and agreeable to them, what a ſweet and contented life might we have in the Wilderneſs; therefore labour to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your deſires. A <hi>4th</hi> Direction is, labour to deſire all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things ſubmiſſively; he did caſt us a noble Copy, that ſaid, <hi>Father, let this cup depart from me, yet not my will be done, but let thy will be done;</hi> what ever temporal Lot we come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if our deſires be according to the Covenant, (let your deſires be for the life of your husband, or this friend, or that Child) they will be with ſubmiſſion, <hi>not my will, but thine be done.</hi> Now theſe four would help you excellently, to get your deſires regulat according to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>I will preſs theſe four with theſe two motives. 1. Know this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:43047:162"/>Chriſtian, that the great reaſon of all the anxiety and torment of thy life, flows not ſo much from thy croſſes, as from thy deſires; the great reaſon of all our torment and anxiety of our life, is not, that God afflicts, but that our deſires are contradicted, readily affliction is according to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the only thing that makes the croſs light to one and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to another is, the tempter of the Spirit; if we could get the victory over our deſires, we might go through the World ſinging, hardly would we be tormented with the things that torment us; one deſires brave apparel, another honour, a third good entertainment, and they want them; it's no: the want of them that is the croſs, but their deſire that makes it the croſs; it's evident from this, one will want their deſires and not be croſt; one will take well with a reeky Cottage, and a piece of brown Bread, that another would account a croſs; the reaſon is, the one's deſire is not like the other. A ſecond motive is, it was one of the great reaſons that made Chriſt have ſo contented a liſe in the World, there was hardly a man the Father had croſt more, than he did him, and yet ye find him never diſcompoſed, he is many time at, <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head;</hi> he is ſometimes led ſo the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſs, and tempted of the Devil, and the Prince of this World comes againſt him, but hath nothing within him, for he had no deſires, therefore he is not diſquieted, he will come to an Hill ſide and ſleep all night, another time he will be on the Sea all night, another time he came to <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, and ſought a drink of Water, he had Tribute to pay when <hi>Ceſars</hi> Tribute was to pay, never one had mo croſſes and more quietneſs, the reaſon is, he had no deſires, if we could get the victory over our pride, our ambition, our laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the hundred part of what we have, would ſatisfie us, but it's our appetite, and not our neceſſity, that hath a great influence on our torment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Thirdly for Uſe, Is the Covenant ſatisfaction to all our deſires? Then the third Uſe is of Conſolation, and it ſpeaks comfortably, eſpecially to three ſorts; 1. To them that it may be have not much ſenſe and experimental proof of God, readily when they go to pray, he hides, he neither gives liberty to pray, nor anſwers he their prayer, ſhall he ſit down and ſay, he hath no ſatisfiction to his deſires? No,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43047:162"/>if he lay in a part of the Covenant to you, the Covenant muſt be taken for the Inheritance, ſo long as we are Minors, we muſt look on the Promiſes as an heretage; and if he lay in a Promiſe, or a part of the Covenant to thee, bring not in a bad report of him, to ſay, thy deſires are not ſatisfied, I came to his door, and I came from it as hungry as I went, and yet he hath given thee a part of the Covenant: It's lamentable to ſee ſo excellent a Covenant, purchaſed by ſuch a perſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by ſuch a Mediator, and to ſee Believers lay ſo little weight on it; ſuppoſe he deny thee ſenſe in thy ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, yet thou haſt ground to ſing, that thou haſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thy deſires, if he lay in a part of the Covenant, and clear up thy intereſt in it. <hi>2ly.</hi> For conſolation, they that go through the World loaden with croſſes, they hardly find the World but ſcouling on them, they may be prone to bring up an ill report on God, to ſay, he gives other folk their deſires, but gives not me mine; but hath he given thee the Covenant, and wilt thou ſay any thing to thy intereſt in the Covenant? And wilt thou yet ſay, he hath not given thee thy deſires? If he hath not given thee thy deſires, they are irregular, go and repent for thy deſires. Haſt thou not in the Covenant drink indeed, Wine, Milk, Honey, Gold, Eye-ſalve, Fields, Fountains, Kingdoms, Cities? And yet wilt thou ſay he hath not given thee all thy deſires? Nay more, haſt thou the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that hath the twelve foundations? Hath he made over by Covenant all that is in God? Remember ye that Note, that in the Covenant, God lays himſelf out to the outmoſt, like a certain King making a feaſt at the marriage of his only Son, if ever a feaſt be great, it will be the feaſt of a King, and the feaſt of a King at the Marriage of his only Son: the ſcope of it is, that God lays himſelf out to the outmoſt, and yet ſhalt thou ſay, he anſwers not all thy deſires? Go not to complain of your straw-bed, nor of your Bread, though it were never ſo brown, if ye have an intereſt in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ye have all your deſires, and more than ye can deſire, for there is ſomething in God our appetire cannot deſire. <hi>3ly.</hi> It ſpeaks comfortably to them, who know not what may be before them; O! may ſome ſay, if I go forward, I will fall over head and ears, and all; and another ſays, O! I am afraid I fall away, and many torment themſelves with what is to come, and the evil they feared fell on them; but why
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43047:163"/>art thou tormented, that has an Intereſt in the Covenant? If thou have that, thou haſt all that thy heart can deſire, I will cloſe all with exhorting all of you, to labour to regulat our deſires according to the Covenant; when ye find ye deſire a thing ye cannot produce a Promiſe for, ſuſpect it as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable deſire, and all that hath gotten the victory over the corruption of their heart, if ye can go this night and ly down, and appeal to him that is the fearcher of the heart, ye deſire no more than what is promiſed, its an evidence he hath mortified your deſires, and brought you under the Bond of the Covenant; bleſſed are they that can ſay, the Lord hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, and deſire no more if he would make me a King, nay, and give me all that is betwixt the riſing of the Sun and the going down thereof, I deſire no more, for he hath made with me a Covenant.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>DAvid</hi> is deſcribing the Covenant that God made with him, that it was everlaſting, and well ordered, and ſure; he builds two great Concluſions on it, this is all my ſalvation and all my deſire; the latter of theſe I have ſpoken to, it's a great mercy, when we can have our deſires regulat according to the Covenant; when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſired, but promiſed mercies; irregular deſires are the great foundation of the torment of our life, they cannot chooſe but have ſweet contentment, and a life full of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, that have gotten the victory over their deſires, not warranted by the Covenant.</p>
            <p>But I will ſay no more of this, before I leave theſe two, there is one thing yet lying in them, <hi>all my ſalvation, and all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;</hi> the two joyned together imports, that the Covenant is a perfect Charter, it's a very rational Deduction from it. That
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43047:163"/>which is all the ground of the hope of ſalvation, and that which is ſatisfaction to all deſires, muſt be a perfect Covenant; therefore, before I leave the handling of this Character of the Covenant, I will take in this, and handle it this day.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>That the Covenant of Grace made with believers, is a perfect Covenant,</hi> it is a very uſeful character of it, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and therefore hearken unto it; it may be ſaid of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 19.7. ſays, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul;</hi> and that which he ſays Pſal. 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Commandment is exceeding broad;</hi> it's as much as, I can ſee no end of thy Commands, they are ſo full and ſo perfect; this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent character and property of the Covenant; whereas in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, we can ſee nothing but vanity, and emptineſs, and froth, there is a perfection in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>That I may the more diſtinctly handle this, I will propoſe theſe four things to be dwelt on. 1. I will prove by ſome reaſons, that the Covenant of God is a perfect Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in what reſpects it is perfect. <hi>3ly.</hi> I ſhall clear ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and anſwer ſome Objections againſt its perfection; and in the laſt place, I ſhall dwell on the practical part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſons Firſt.</hi> For ſome reaſons to prove, that the Covenant is perfect; and indeed it's not eaſie to believe the Covenant to be perfect, every one will have their Objection againſt it; yet there are theſe four things, that will very ſtrongly concur to demonſtrat that it is a perfect Covenant. 1. That to which nothing can be added. and from which nothing can be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt be a perfect Covenant, that is the proper definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perfection; now this agrees well to the Covenant, there is nothing wanting in it, and nothing can be added to it; it is remarkable Rev. 22. <hi>He that adds to the words of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, God ſhall add to him the plagues written in this book; and he that takes from it, God ſhall take his name out of the book of life;</hi> that is one ſure reaſon, to prove it a perfect Covenant. Papiſts tell us, they ſay they add no corrupt additions, but perfecting additions to the words of this Book; now, corrupt additions is a contradiction, for a corruption is not an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Covenant is ſo perfect, as whoſoever he be that offers to add to the words of this Book, God will add to him the plagues of this Book, and whoſoever he be that takes from it, God will take his name out of the Book of life.</p>
            <pb n="320" facs="tcp:43047:164"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. That Covenant that is ſufficient to make the man of God perfect, muſt be a perfect Covenant: that which is in it ſelf ſufficient to make a Believer perfect, what can be more requlſite to make up perfection as to us, but the thing that will make us perfect? And the Covenant is ſufficient to make the man of God perfect. 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs:</hi> Now, ſince they are ſufficient to make the man of God Perfect, the Covenant muſt be a perfect Covenant that is thus uſeful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. It will prove a perfect Covenant, if ye conſider that God in the Covenant is at the outmoſt of his offers; now there can be nothing wanting, if God be at the outmoſt of what he can offer. There are three things that in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant evidences God to be at his outmoſt, ſo to ſpeak with reverence, that he cannot go beyond the three. 1. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant, he cannot go beyond them, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offer greater things than himſelf and his Son, and both theſe are promiſed in the Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> He is at the outmoſt of the freedom of the terms, on which theſe offers are made: it's impoſſible to make an offer on freer terms, that we ſhould accept of him, and turn from our iniquity and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and incline our ear to the Covenant; what eaſier terms was it poſſible for God to make ſuch great offers on? <hi>3ly.</hi> He is at his outmoſt as to the Seals and Security of the Covenant; it's remarkable, when he confirm'd the Covenant to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Heb</hi> 6. Becauſe he had no greater to ſwear by, he ſwore by himſelf that imports, that he gave the greateſt Oath he could make, if he could have ſworn by a greater, he would have ſworn by it; ſo he is at his outmoſt, as to all theſe three. Muſt not that then be a perfect Covenant, where God is at his outmoſt, and where (to ſpeak with reverence) he can neither make greater offers, nor freer offers, nor give greater ſecurity for his offers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. That muſt be a perfect Covenant, which upon the grounds given in the Text, ſatisfies all deſires, and is all the hope of ſalvation, this proves it a perfect Covenant; our deſires are very vaſt they are ordinarily like the Sea, our deſires are like an Ocean, yet all deſires, and even when they ſhall be racked to the full, the things contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall ſatisfy them, and that for all eternity: ſo the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43047:164"/>cannot but be a perfect Covenant; ſo lay the four to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ye will ſee it a perfect Covenant.</p>
            <p>But the more clear handling of this will appear, if I will particularly enquire into what reſpects it is a perfect Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: It would take a long time to open this, I will confine my ſelf in handling this, to four or five particulars, and in theſe ſhall let you ſee, in what reſpects it's a prefect Covenant 1. It's a perfect Covenant in regard of excellency; it's perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent, if the things contained in the Covenant, had been many things like the gifts <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to <hi>Ketura</hi> his Concubine and her Children, it would be far from being a perfect Covenant, ſuppoſe it had been a liferent Bond, or a lifes Tack of health, or a little whiles flouriſhing in the world, what a ſilly thing had it been in the point of excellency? But the Covenant is perfect in this reſpect, the greateſt things God can give, are contained in it, he will give grace and glory, and no good thing ſhall be wanting to them that live uprightly; no, he cannot offer greater things, he offers in the Covenant all that he hath, and to make us Ruler over all that he hath, <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall that ſervant be, whom his Lord when he cometh finds ſo doing, verily he will make him ruler over all that he hath. 2ly.</hi> It's a perfect Covenant, in regard it holds out not only all theſe excellencies, but it's a Covenant of the moſt excellent things in their perfection, in as far as they are communicable: Divines diſtinguiſh two ſorts of Attributes of God, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, ſome incommunicable. Infiniteneſs is incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Eternity is incommunicable; other Attributes of God are cammunicable, his Wiſdom, his Holineſs, his Juſtice, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All the Attributes of God communicable, are made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us in the Covenant; he promiſeth they ſhall be forth-coming to us,: and there are ſome Rays communicat to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, like Beams proceeding from the Sun, they come from God the Fountain of Wiſdom and Holineſs, all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, in ſo far as it is communicable, and as we ſtand in need of, is made over in the Covenant; there is nothing in the Father or in the Son, that is communicable, but it's made over in the Covenant; ſince it is ſo, that the moſt excellent things are promiſed in the Covenant, and all the excellencies of the Father, and of the Son, in ſo far as they are communicable, and we are capable of, are made over in the Covenant, it muſt then be a perfect Covenant
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43047:165"/>in regard of excellency: What is poſſible for you to imagine? What is deſireable? What is the Father and his Son, and all that's in him, in ſo far as we are capable of, and are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, is made over to us in the Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> It's a perfect Covenant in reſpect of duties; there are two things that make up the whole duty of Man, or of a Chriſtian, and ye will find there was never any thing ſo perfect in both regards, as the Covenant is. 1. The Covenant is perfect in regard of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. <hi>2ly.</hi> In regard of Vivification. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's perfect in regard of Mortification, the Heathens and all Hypocrites know nothing of this myſtery of the Covenant, the Covenant is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in regard of Mortification; if ye view three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the work of Mortification. ye will find them all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for in the Covenant. 1. The Covenant requires, that we ſhould not only mortifie outward and ſcandalous luſts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inward heart-luſts; the Covenant calls for both the two, all the Law-gives that ever gave Laws to the world. their Laws ſtrike not at heart-ills, but the Covenant is thus perfect, as the luſts of the heart, the luſt of the eye, eyes full of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even that the Covenant condemns, and makes Adultery; and ſo its perfect, in regard it not only ſneds off the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but it ſtrikes at the root, even or heart-luſts. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Covenant it preſſes the mortification of leſſer things, even the things that we would think but a ſmall evil, the Covenant preſſes that we ſhould watch againſt every iniquity, and count nothing ſmall that is committed againſt a great God. <hi>3ly</hi> The Covenant not only preſſes the mortification of heart-ills, and the leaſt ills, but it preſſes the mortification of the moſt dear things, and things moſt precious to us, ſuch as the right hand, the right eye, Mat. 5.29. <hi>If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee, if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>better to go to Heaven with one eye, than to go to Hell with two;</hi> ſo argues Chriſt, the ſmalleſt ſin, the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſin, and the deareſt of things, though it were as dear as the right eye, &amp; the right hand, they muſt be mortified, and muſt not that be a perfect Covenant, that gives ſo perfect Laws?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take a view of Vivification, and of poſitive duties ſupradded to the work of Mortification, and ye will find it perfect in regard of theſe, eſpecially if ye notice three things. 1. The Covenant preſſes univerſal obedience to the Law, not only the firſt Table of the Law, but the ſecond, not only duties
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43047:165"/>to God, but to our neighbour; the Covenant preſſes a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of all that God ſays, <hi>God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying,</hi> is the Preface to the Ten Commandments; they are all the words of God, if one of them had been ſpoken by the god of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> if a ſecond had been ſpoken by the god of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we might have ſaid, this was ſpoken by the god of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and is not to be obeyed; but all the Commands are the Words of God, and therefore all are to be obeyed. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Covenant in the point of Vivification, declares againſt ſlothiulneſs as well as ſcandals, the Covenant ſays, the Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, or the careleſs or barren Tree, will be caſt into the fire, as well as the Tree that brings forth Accorns, and that is an evidence of the perfection of the Covenant; it's well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of <hi>Jonah,</hi> a ſleeping <hi>Jonah</hi> may ruine a Ship, as well as a Pirat; had there come an Enemy, or a Pirat upon the Ship that <hi>Jonah</hi> ſleeped in, it could not contribute more to ruine it, than his ſleeping; ſecurity and ſlothfulneſs will bring thee to Hell, as well as the groſſeſt ſcandals. <hi>3ly.</hi> The Covenant calls for Grace as well as duty; there is nothing acceptable duty to God, but what hath grace at the bottom of it, if we give our body to the fire, and want charity, if we pray never ſo much, and pray not in faith, it's not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there is no right work of Sanctification, except the work conſiſt of Grace as well as duties: muſt not that be a perfect Covenant, as to all the duties of Mortification and Vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that requires ſuch exact obedience, as ye ſee required in it? <hi>4ly.</hi> It's perfect, in reſpect it's a compleat anſwer to all our neceſſities; there is nothing our neceſſity can call for, but it's contained in the Covenant, the truth of this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if ye take notice of two things. 1. There is no want a Believer can be lyable to, but readily ye will get two Promiſes in the Covenant relating to it; ſome have taken the pains to caſt them up, and in their Treatiſes made appear, that there is no want a Chriſtian can come under, but in the Covenant there will be at leaſt two Promiſes for one want, if ye go through particularly; is it a heart of ſtone ye complain of? Is it an unclean heart? Is it weakneſs of Grace? Is it the ſtrength of corruption? Be what it will, ye ſhall readily find two Promiſes for what ever want a Chriſtian can come under. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Covenant holds out Chriſt in all his three Offices, it's certain, Chriſt being appointed of the Father a Phyſician, a
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43047:166"/>Mediator, a Propitiation, he muſt be ſuited to all our wants; now Chriſt in his fulneſs is holden out in the Covenant; ſo the Covenant in all the Promiſes of it, is nothing but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his threefold Office, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet in the Church; hence I rationally infer, it's a perfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for if there be a fulneſs in Chriſt, in whom a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is compleat, and that fulneſs be communicat and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, according to the tenor of the Covenant, then it muſt be a perfect Covenant, for there is no want, there is no ſtrait, there is no caſe that can be perplexing, but at leaſt ye ſhall find two promiſes, if not ſometimes ſix relating to it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to prove it a perfect Covenant, that muſt be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Covenant, the bleſſings whereof are to be eternal; indeed if they ended, if there were but a Liferent-tack of them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſhould give us a Tack of peace and of pardon, and all that God hath; ſuppoſe he ſhould have made over all that he hath in the Covenant, and only given us ſeventy years Tack o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them, as he hath given us of our life, and the date of our time, though it had been perfect in excellency, yet it had not beet perfect in duration, but this makes it perfed in all things, and well ordered, that as the excellency of it ſtands in this, that all that is in God, and all the righteouſneſs of his Son is made over to us; ſo it is to endure for all eternity. Now lay theſe four together, and ye will ſee that the truth of this is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, that among many excellent characters and propet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Covenant, this is a ſpecial one, that it is perfect.</p>
            <p>Before I apply this Doctrine, there are three Objections, one of them made by <hi>Quakers,</hi> another by <hi>Papists,</hi> and a third by <hi>Epiſcopal men,</hi> and Patrons of Ceremonies; and all the three I will remove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt, it may be Objected, this Covenant is not perfect, why? There are many things revealed by a voice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us (ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi>) not contained in the Scriptures; that cannot be a perfect Covenant, that contains not all things neceſſar for Salvation, and this Covenant contains not all things neceſſar for Salvation; why? The Spirit reveals this and that to me, when there is no nearneſs to him, and this is neceſſar, and therefore the Covenant cannot be perfect; and indeed <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are multiplying, and againſt whom Miniſters ſhould give warning, they are twining up their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts to this head, for if they gain this, that the Spirit reveals
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43047:166"/>new Truths, not contained in the Bible, they gain all their deſire; what ever is born in on a man, they call it the work of the Spirit, now what can be Replyed to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For Anſwer to this, and to guard againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of theirs, ye would take notice of three or four things about it. 1. The proper work of the Spirit of Truth, is not to reveal new Truths, but to open the eyes to the Truths already revealed; when the Spirit, the Comforter, comes, he will guide you in all Truth, and bring all things to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the work of the Spirit of Truth is to bring all things already revealed to our remembrance; <hi>The Spirit when he comes, he ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it you.</hi> John 14.16. That is, He ſhall take my Covenant, and my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhall ſhew it to you: ſo the work of the Spirit of Truth is, to bring things to our remembrance, that Chriſt hath already revealed, when they are put to it; they cannot in all the Bible ſhew the leaſt Promiſe, that the Spirit will reveal new Truths, but will bring things already revealed to our remembrance. <hi>2ly.</hi> Take notice, that this Principle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, one of the greateſt reflections on the Scripture, if there were no more to make it odious to you than this, it is enough, for it ſays, the word of God is not perfect, the Spirit ſays, it is perfect, and cloſes the Bible with it, <hi>If any ſhall add to the propheſies of this Book, God ſhall add to him all the plagues contained in this Book;</hi> if there were no more to make it abominat, and odious, by all ſober Chriſtians, this reflection that it contains, on the perfect rule of manners, the Scriptures and Covenant of God, it is enough; and who will maintain a neceſſity of Revelation of new Truths, muſt maintain, that the things already reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were not perfect, and conſequently reflect on God, who hath given man a rule, but not a perfect rule. <hi>3ly.</hi> The evil of this will appear, in regard it were the way to deſtroy, and to turn not only mankind, but the Church of God into confuſion; by what rule ſhall one diſcern the thing born in upon us, to be from the Spirit? They ſay, they are to judge the Spirit by the thing born in upon us, and not to judge the thing born in on us by the Spirit; Therefore in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> it was ſo born in on a man, to that hight, as to kill his own Wife, and one another, to blaſpheme God, and one another to commit Inceſt, and ſhall we judge ſuch blaſphemies

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will only ſay theſe three things of theſe Traditions. 1. Take notice, that the moſt part of the thing; they offer for Traditions, as neceſſar for Salvation, if ye would but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the grounds on which they are taken up, ye would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, that men of ſuch parts, go upon ſuch ſhallow grounds; They ſay, their Traditions muſt come from the Apoſtles; why? Becauſe we cannot tell when they came into the Church, ſuch as the Office of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> &amp;c. As if a man cannot tell, there is a Burn running through the Town, that yet cannot tell the Spring-head, out of which it comes: now, is not this a very ſhallow ground, theſe Traditions muſt be <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> becauſe

               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. May it not be ſaid, are there not many things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſary for Believers in their Faith and Practiſes, that are not contained in the Scriptures? As for example, if there be a Queſtion about Forms of Eccleſiaſtick Government, that is not determined in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this, I will ſay two things. 1. It is enough to me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtly to have averſion from any form of Government, if it be not determined in the Scriptures; many confeſs this, and yet they own <hi>Prelacy,</hi> they ſay in all the Word of God, God hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eft no particular Direction to ſuch and ſuch Officers, but what he hath left to all Miniſters, he hath impoſed no Duty on them, nor hath he told people now to carry to them, in all the Bible; is not this a ſufficient reaſon againſt them? Is not this a yielding of the Cauſe? But <hi>2ly</hi> The Covenant is perfect, as to this, the Lord hath determined a form of Government, and hath ſet it up even among preaching Miniſters of the Goſpel, giving them the ſame qualifications, with any diſtinction; the Lord hath poſitively determined all things neceſſar for ſuch and ſuch Offices, and herein the Covenant is perfect, in regard it poſitively determines, what form of Government the Maſter of the houſe would have in his own houſe.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, are there not many things relating to worſhip, that are not determined in the Scriptures? Such as Forms, Geſtures and Garbs, and ſuch like, and are theſe determined in the Scriptures? For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> if they be not determined in the Scriptures, they ſhould not be practiſed, and this is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument; it's ordinarily the Whore that busks her ſelf, let the Whore, or the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church wear a buskin all hanging with Ribbens, but let not the true Church wear that Garb; for the Bride, ſhe is ay comlieſt in her native purity; and really Gods Ordinances have another manner of Grace, in their naked
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43047:168"/>purity, we need not ſet Forms in our Worſhip, all theſe things are determined in general Rules in the Scripture, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> let all things be done without ſtrife, and let them be done in charity. To be brief, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in time and eternity, but it is contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo it muſt be a perfect Covenant.</p>

            <p>PErfection is a comprehenſive Property of the Covenant, I can ſay no more of it than I have ſaid, Perfection is a thing, to which nothing can be added, and to which nothing is wanting; I laboured to convince you of this.</p>
            <p>The practical part of the Point remains to be handled. Is the Covenant a perfect Covenant? There are three or four practical Uſes of it, I will follow; I confeſs there is hardly any thing in Time that we can aſcribe the name of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto; the moſt excellent of perſons have ſome defects, there is ſomething wanting in them, there is ſomething in their humour, and in their way, that ſays, they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the moſt excellent of things are ſo, the Roſe will fade, and it hath a Brier in it, but the Covenant is perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. It ſerves then to reprove theſe, who take it not up as perfect; and there are three or four ſorts of Perſons, that come under this Reproof. 1 It reproves <hi>Quakers,</hi> that tell us of new Truths, that will be revealed to one man, and not to another, they reflect on the Scriptures, they ſay the Covenant is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they blaſpheme God and deſtroy humane Societies; they make no Church certain till their Revelation come; all that hath been done by Chriſt, may be overturned by a new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ye ought to be guarding againſt this Principle, they will be lying among you, and ye not know them, this is their great Principle, and that which now in their Books, they are hoteſt in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43047:168"/>following, guard againſt it, as ye would have God's peace, and hold by this, that the Covenant is perfect, it contains all your ſalvation, and all your deſire. <hi>2ly.</hi> It reproves <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the bulk of whoſe Religion lies in humane Inventions and Traditions; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves well, it's a ground to ſuſpect them ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Scriptures, for they will not admit the Scriptures to be the Judge of Controverſies; it's even like a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining a Judge, becauſe he ſuſpects him; but we maintain this Covenant to be a perfect Covenant, it contains all our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and all our deſire; and we bid no more for the mind of God, than what is contained in it; and until we ſee him, we will take theſe Letters of his, and truſt them, and walk by them, and expect from him, according to what is contained in this perfect Covenant. <hi>3ly.</hi> It reproves theſe among us, who will have the Covenant perfect, as to all things relating to Faith, but they will not have it a perfect Rule of Manners, they ſay, for Ceremonies and Forms of Government, we are not to ſeek them from Scripture, and a Covenant; and where ſhould we ſeek them, if we ſeek them not there? And what have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to do in his houſe, that hath not his Warrand, if there be not determinations in the Word about them, and if they cannot pretend to Chriſt's Commiſſion, what Warrand have they to his houſe? O! they cut the throat of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, while they deny this. <hi>4ly.</hi> It reproves many practical Chriſtians, who do not take the Covenant for a perfect Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Frequently it comes to be the caſe of a Chriſtian, to doubt and queſtion, and ſit down (like a Woman in Travail, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe will never be delivered) ſeeking after ſome Senſe and Experience, unleſs God communicat ſomething that will tickle their affection, they cannot take the Covenant, nor a Promiſe of the Covenant; thou does not believe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be a perfect Covenant; readily thou ſpeaks of it, as if it wanted out thy caſe; thou will ſay, it contains many things, but alas it wants out my caſe, thou underſtands not the nature of it, for it's a perfect Covenant, it's all thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all thy deſire, and there is nothing wanting in it, that he that was wiſer than thou, thought neceſſar to be put in it. All theſe comes under this reproof, and however thou joyns with <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> and all the Patrons of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; in an hour of Temptation, when thou takes not the Covenant for a perfect Covenant, yet it is a perfect Covenant.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe of the Point, is the Covenant ſo perfect a Covenant, it contains what God can promiſe, and all that we can deſire? then it ſerves for Information, and there are four or five things it informs of, and that a Chriſtian ſhould ſeriouſly ponder. 1. Is it a perfect Covenant? It informs of the Obligation we have to him that made it, and to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator that treated it; there is nothing can be added to it. O! but he managed the buſineſs well, and there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, for it's a perfect Covenant, there is hardly a man hath a buſineſs, but we will find ſome fault. I like well the Obſervation a Moraliſt hath, ſays he, there are many, they are like Witches, in finding out faults, wheras Wit lies rather in covering faults; it's the greateſt Wit that can beſt defend a bad Cauſe; ordinarily, there is no man can go through the World, but there are ay ſome ſaying, ſee the fool, but what fault can ye find in the management of this Covenant, for it's perfect? I appeal in cold blood to any Chriſtian, is there any thing can be added, or wanting in it? He that managed it, was Chriſt the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God, that carried the buſineſs ſo, as the moſt cenſorious Wit, can neither add, nor find a want in it: ſome tell of one a Critick, in the whole courſe of his life, he could ſcarcely find one action that pleaſed him; whatever any did, he found ay a fault in it; but bring out this Covenant, and give him the Spectacles of a Chriſtian, and he will find it a perfect Covenant, he would not find in it the leaſt fault or want; nor is there any thing to be added to it, which preclaims the Wiſdom of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; our buſineſs was better in his hand, than if it had been in ours; for if we had had the managing of it, either there would be ſomething added or wanting; but he managed it ſo, as there's nothing can be added or wanting. <hi>2ly.</hi> Is it thus a perfect Covenant, then not only bleſs the Mediator, but make uſe of it, improve it a a perfect Covenant; there is indeed the great uſe of the Point I would dwell a little on, and help you to improve it as a perfect Covenant; there are four caſes wherein we are to improve it as a perfect Covenant. 1. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to improve it in all Debates, this is a time full of Debates, ye ſhall find hardly two meet in one judgement in all things; here is Chriſt, ſays one; there is Chriſt, ſays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; there is one thing cryed up this year, another thing cryed up the next year; but the Covenant is a perfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43047:169"/>bring all your debates to the Scriptures, and to the Covenant, do not ſtand on the Judgment of Rantars, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane wicked men, that readily will not turn over a Chapter of the Bible in a week, it's impoſſible for them to know the word of God, no queſtion, they may rant, and they may alter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſhallow wits, like men groping in darkneſs, and knows not at what they ſtumble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the law and to the teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them:</hi> In all queſtions of the time that thou art tryſted with in this world, if thou would be a perſon that would look out like a witty one, and a man of underſtanding, be well acquaint with the Scriptures, and underſtand them well; I would not value a man that is un-acquainted with the Scriptures, more than the barking of a Dog. 2. Improve it in all things that relate to your peace, <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> tell us, they can afford peace to the wicked, it's true their principle leads them to that, but we tell them, it will not be a ſpiritual peace, it will not be according to the Covenant; let them ſpeak peace, it's not Chriſt that ſpeaks peace, it's no peace from the inferior Judge, if the ſupream Judge condemn it; what ſignifies peace from all the Miniſters in the world, if the Maſter ſay, <hi>depart from me, I know you not;</hi> and if he ſay, <hi>come to me, little children,</hi> what ſignifies it, if all the Miniſters in the world ſay, <hi>depart from me?</hi> therefore take up the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as a perfect Rule in order to your peace; if it ſpeak peace to you, take the peace of it: if it ſpeak war to you, take it, for it's a perfect Rule, to which nothing can be added. 3. I exhort Chriſtians to improve it in a third caſe, and that is, to bear off Challenges and Temptations; frequently they come multiplying, take the Covenant, it's a perfect Covenant, why go ye about to be diſquieted with, I think, and I fear, when it may be, neither thy thought, nor thy fear, hath a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual warrand; take the Covenant, it's perfectly the mind of God, and if ye knew how to improve it, readily ye might find, that there is no Temptation, nor Challenge of what kind ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but ye may find an anſwer to it in the Covenant. I will offer you but theſe three things, that may occur, and they moſt ordinarily meet you. 1. Ye have a natural heart, go to the Covenant with it, it's perfect, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone;</hi> I like it well to ſee Parents, that teach their young ones to pray, they put this Promiſe and that in their hand; ye that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43047:170"/>have a gate of it, put in this Promiſe in their hand, I will take away the heart of ſtone, teach them in their youth to preſs this Promiſe, and bid them go to God, and the Covenant, where they will find this among the firſt Promiſes, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and I will give you a new heart.</hi> 2 If your caſe be great guiltineſs, what ſhould ye do with it, ſhould ye ſit down and deſpair, and caſt away your hope and conſidence, and be waiting for death, as the Meſſenger that will take you to Hell; no, go to the Covenant with it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow, though they be red as crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll. Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy ſins.</hi> But 3. If the Challenge were, that ye want Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and cannot get a heart broken for theſe things, ye have committed againſt God, go to the Covenant, and ye will find the Promiſes of Repentance; for as I ſaid, it's a perfect Covenant, I defy you to inſtance the caſe ye can be in, but there may be two Promiſes made to it, if not ſix; therefore be improving the Covenant in all your debates and diſputes of the time, in all things that relate to your conſolation, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to your Challenges. 4. I exhort you to improve the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in all your duties, make uſe of it as a perfect Covenant, I declare from this place this day, that I take nothing for my duty to God, but what is contained in the Covenant; no man, nor ſociety of men can make duties to God, nothing can be a duty to God meerly from the will of men; nay more; it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make it a quarrel, if we worſhip him according to the Traditions of men, and no wonder, for it ſays, this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is not perfect, therefore nothing can be a duty to God from men; though they were never ſo perfect or holy, they cannot make duties, but what are contained in the Covenant, and they who will take upon them to ſay, this is a duty, and this is a duty, and the contrair is a ſin, they take Gods Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on them, for it's he that makes duties, and it's he that hath made them perfectly in this Covenant, and they that can keep up the duties of the Covenant, they will in due time be made perfect in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. The third Uſe of the Point, Is it a perfect Covenant? then it's encouraging and comfortable to Believers; O! to be under a perfect Covenant, it's very comforting and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, in theſe four or five Caſes. 1. Compare your caſe with
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43047:170"/>the caſe of the generality of men, the generality of men, they are ſeeking their contentment in other things than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but the things are not perfect; It's obſerved, there are three great imperfections in all the Creatures. 1. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Creature compleat, there is neither Perfection nor Thing, even though men ſhould ſay it were perfect in its own kind, yet not in every kind, ſome have Strength, and they want Wit; ſome have Beauty, and they have a wicked ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; ſome have Riches, and they are baſe; ſome have Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and they are poor; there is ay ſome Briar in their Roſe; ye will find ſeveral Worthies mentioned in the Scripture, who had their own imperfections, <hi>David</hi> he had uprightneſs, but he was not free of Scandal; <hi>Moſes</hi> had meekneſs, yet he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not impatience; <hi>Abraham</hi> had Faith, yet he wanted not fear of his Life, when he went to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Court; there was in them a Roſe that bloſſomed, but there was ay a Briar beſide it; hardly can it be ſaid of any thing, that ever was, that was ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>And ye are compleat in him.</hi> 2. There is an imperfection in the Creature of durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſuppoſe it were compleat, yet it cannot laſt, like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, it ſhadowed him from the heat of the ſun in the day, but at the evening it withered; a little time puts an end to it, there is no perfection of duration in the Creature, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the the ſtrength of my heart, &amp;c.</hi> 3. There is an imperfection of ſuitableneſs, ſuppoſe the thing were intirely compleat and laſting, yet our humor and inclination may change, according to our appetite, for ſuppoſe the thing continue compleat and endure, yet our inclination may alter; hardly are there any thing conſtantly enjoyed, but the ordinar uſe of them is enough to give a ſurfeit of them. Now, there is imperfection in the Creature, but in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant there will be no change, the thing is compleat; and ay the more enjoyed, there is the greater appetite, and the more longing deſire. Therefore, ye that have an intereſt in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, compare your caſe with all others, and ſuppoſe ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not count on ſuch Bonds, and ſuch Charters of Lands, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they have but a periſhing good, and ye have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the everlaſting Covenant; be comforted with compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your caſe with others. 2. I exhort you that have an intereſt in this Covenant, to learn to underſtand your priviledge; there are many Believers, like a young Heir, that cannot read nor
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:43047:171"/>write, they underſtand not their Charter; ſo many Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers underſtand not their priviledge, becauſe their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is imperfect, they go mourning and complaining of their caſe, while their underſtanding of the Covenant is imperfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> I would move here one practical Queſtion, what courſe a Believer ſhould take, to underſtand the Covenant in its perfection?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I will offer you three Rules, that may prove helpful to you 1. I would exhort you, ye have variety of Caſes, whiles ye are full, whiles poor, whiles reproached, whiles deſerted, whiles tempted, go to the Covenant with every caſe, and that will train you, and teach you the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, readily ye have ſcarcely the confidence ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to do it; but this was the way of Mr. <hi>Dickson,</hi> if any thing troubled him, he laboured ay to get a Promiſe, and if he got it, he rejoyced, and in his old age, he wrote the Book <hi>Therapeutica Sacra,</hi> the cure of all caſes by the Covenant; and if ye make uſe of the Covenant, ye will find there is no diſcouragement, no affliction, but ye will find a remedy for it in the Covenant. 2. I exhort you to be much in fear, filial fear, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant;</hi> the ready way to be acquaint with the Covenant is, to be a Chriſtian much in fear, why does not he ſay, <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that love him?</hi> that <hi>rejoyce in him?</hi> or that <hi>believe in him?</hi> the perſon that is fearing him, is driven to the Covenant. 3. If ye would underſtand your priviledge, and underſtand the Covenant, be more a ſtudent of the Covenant; conſider the grounds ye heard laid down. he hath laid himſelf out to the utmoſt, he hath never holden in making Promiſes, until he hath made that Promiſe, <hi>He will make him ruler over all that he hath;</hi> He hath ay gone on in making one Promiſe upon the back of another, until he make over all that he hath; and make the perſon Ruler over all that he hath, and what would ye deſire more? or imagine more? He put in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of peace, Promiſes of pardon, promiſes of Adoption, and of Effectual Calling, and of taking away the heart of ſtone, and never ſtopped at Promiſes making, till he come to make him Ruler over all that he hath; and if ye were ſtudying this, ye might underſtand your priviledge; and I
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43047:171"/>am perſwaded all the diſquietings ye might come under, flows from the not underſtanding the Covenant, therefore underſtand your priviledge.</p>
            <p>That I may cloſe this point, I will ſpeak a word to two or three Caſes, 1. It ſpeaks a word to thoſe, that ſeek their contentment in other things than the Covenant; ſome ſeek contentment in their luſts, ſome in the company of the wicked, ſome in their riches, ſome in their honour, but ye are all ſeeking hot Water under cold Ice, ye will not find it there; <hi>Incline your ear and hear, and I will make a Covenant with you; why ſpend ye your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> And I will tell you where ye will find it; there is a well ordered and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, and that is the only thing that will afford true contentment; ye will find there perfect pleaſure, Bread Milk, Wine, Honey, Gold, ye will find Cities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. and ye will find all theſe in the Covenant, in the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and not in the Shell; ſeek not your contentment in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, for the things that may give you content the day, may be your grief the morn, they may be a ſting in your Conſcience the morn, and like fire in your boſom, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ear and hear, why ſpend ye your money for that whick is not bread? The Lord hath a quarrel with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hear not, as with the people of old, <hi>my people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me, the funtain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, and hewed out to themſelves ciſterns, broken ciſterns that cvna hold no water.</hi> 2. It ſpeaks to theſe, that think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers the greateſt fools and Phanatick in the world; why? They taken them to you Covenant; ye know not what ye ſay, it's a perfect Covenant. it hath perfect promiſes, and made upon the eaſieſt terms; it hath perfect Seals, the Lord cannot add a greater Seal to than he hath added; and think ye that Phanaticiſm? No, all of you that are following the world, and making a Covenant with the Eaſt-wind, ye know not what ye are depriving your ſelf of, no, it's no Phanaticiſm, it's the ſolideſt, the ſureſt, and the moſt ratioal way that ever a man took hmſelf to; take yourſelf to this Covenant, why? It's a perfect Covenant, it's impoſſible to add to it, or take any thing from it. 3. Imention thoſe that have taken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, and exhorts you to be encouraged; and here for their encouragement I will ſay two things. 1. I exhort
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:43047:172"/>you that have taken your ſelf to it as a perfect Covenant, to which if ye were racking your wit, ye could add nothing; I exhort you to be encouraged under your imperfect priviledges, ye neigher get in the wilderneſs the meat, the reputation, the ſtrenath, the fellowſhip with God, that others get, ye could bear the better with all other things, if he made it up: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imperfection be in the priviledge, ye have a perfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, therefore go through the world as the young, Heir not yet come to his Inheritance, and that hath not much to ſpend, yet he hath an excellent Charter, and excellent Bonds: So whatever imperfection be in your priviledge, ye have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Covenant, be exhorted to rejoyce upon the account of the Covenant; it's a wonder to ſee <hi>David</hi> ſpend, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and nineteenth Pſalm, and never a word of Chriſt in it all, except in one Verſe, but in every Verſe he mentions the Law, and Covenant, of God; <hi>I will riſe at midnight and praiſe thee, becauſe of thy goodneſs, I will ſing of thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> therefore rejoyce in the Covenant, for it is perfect, and any that make their Religionly in complaints, all that ye ſay to God is complaints, and all that ye ſay to your neithbours is complaints; take a rebuke in the Name of God, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ground of complaint ye have, ye ought to rejoyce in the Covenant, for it is perfect, and there is nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, nor taken from it. 2. I would have you who have the marks I have often given you, of an intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to bring forth the Covenant, and not only make it a ſong to God, but offer it to your Conſciences, when your challenges grow; if we were laying ſtrſs upon the Covenant, and taking it up as a perfect Covenant, we might have a better life of it than we have, but ingorance of the Covenant makes, that the half of his allowance is not enjoyed.</p>

            <p>HAving ſpoken to the nature and properties or the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veant, and reſolving not to dwell much longer on this Text, I come to the latter thing that I ſuppoſe is to be handled in it; there are two Objections that might
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43047:172"/>be made againſt <hi>Davids</hi> conſolation from the Covenant, one taken from his own guilt and the guilt of his houſe, <hi>although my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> another taken from Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and hsi diſpenſations to him, <hi>although he make it not to grow;</hi> ſo we ſhall handle the beginning and the cloſe of the Verſe gotether, as beſt agreeing to the method that I propoſed, and did caſt the words into.</p>
            <p>The firſt Objection I will begin this day, which is, the ſmell of his guilt, and the guilt of his houſe, <hi>though my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> &amp;c. It's made a great Queſtion, and there are diverſe opoinions about what is meant by <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, whether it take in the ſtate of the Kingdom and Church, as ſometimes it doeth in Scripture, or whether it be his particular family, in which there was abounding In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, Murther, and Adultery, and many other things; or whether it be the houſe of his body, and the tabernacle of his body, his perſon where there were many failings; like wife the meaning of the phraſe, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God.</hi> though it be not legally qualified, and be not ſo with God, as either God or I would have it; for ther emuſt be ſome ſuch thing here, <hi>yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> ſo that before I can come to ſpeak of his houſe, and the failings conſiſtent with the Covenant, and of the anſwering their failings in the Covenant; there is one thing I cannot paſs, and will handle it this day, it's this, comparing the Objection and the Priviledge together, my houſe is ſinful, it's not ſo with God, yet notwithſtanding it be ſo, ha hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The Obſervation ſhall be, <hi>That the Covenant made with believers, it's a Covenant of Grace;</hi> it's abſolutely of Grace, that Lord makes the Covenant with them, although their houſe be not ſo with God, yet the Covenant is made with them, and this intirely proves it a Covenant of Grace. I will in the work of this day, comparing the Covenant with <hi>David'</hi>s houſe, handle this to you, that it's a Covenant of Grace, it's an abſolutely this to you, that it's a Covenant; it's a remarkable confirmation of this you have <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.32. The Lord hath in the former Verſes, ſet down many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſes in the Covenant, ſuch as, <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, a new heart will I give you, and I will put a new ſpirit within you, I will take away the ſtony heart, I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and write my Laws in your heart;</hi> and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:43047:173"/>Verſe 32. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you, be aſhamed and confounded for your own way, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Many precious promiſes hath he made in the Covenant, yet for the riſe of them, be it known to you, ſaith the Lord God, not for your ſakes do I this: That I may follow this a little, I confeſs it's the great thing of our Soul, it we were this day going to the grave, that he ſhould make a Covenant with you, whoſe houſe is not ſo with God.</p>
            <p>I will firſt prove this Covenant made with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed, to be abſolutely and intirely a Covenant of Grace. 2. I will inquire into the reaſons, why God will have this Covenant of Grace. 3. I will clear a Queſtion or two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and laſtly ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt to prove it a Covenant of Grace, that is a Covenant of free favour, that's made with them, whoſe houſe is not ſo with God, it's a pathetick expreſſion, there is much more implyed than is expreſt. That the Covenant is a Covenant of meer grace and free favour, will appear from theſe three remarkable truths. 1. We have no acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in procuring it. 2. The grounds and motives of it are only in God. 3. It hath all the properties of grace and favour into it that could be expected, to prove it a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. 1. It proves it a Covenant of free grace, abſolutely of free favour, in regard we are altogether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from having any hand in procuring it: It's obſerved in Diſpute with Papiſts, there are four wavs by which we might be conceived to influence a thing from God, and all theſe we are ſecluded from. 1. By was of merit; 2. By way of prive. 3. By way of ſervice. 4. If there were ſuitableneſs in us to it; ſeveral times there is beauty and comelineſs, where there is neither merit, nor price, nor ſervice, that will be alluring and procuring, but all the four ways we are ſecluded from having any hand in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no merit; there are two things neceſſary to make up merit; 1. The thing we give muſt be our own. 2. It muſt be proportioned to the thing we receive; the School-men cry down merit on theſe two grounds; in ſtrict Juſtice, the thing we merit muſt be of ſomething of our own, we muſt have a proportion of the thing to what we receive, and there is nothing of this in us in ſtrict Juſtice,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43047:173"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> could not merit any thing that could have the name of merit, it did refult from the Covenant, and not from his obedience, for it was neither his own, nor proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to what he was to receive, there could not be a proper commutative Juſtice betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> even though he had kept the Covenant of Works, far leſs could we merit, lapſed man could not merit under the Covenant of Grace: 2. As we could give no merit, we could give no price; the reaſon of this is, the outmoſt we could do was, Sacrifices and Offerings, all the Heathens could never go beyond this, when they ſet their wits a-work to pleaſe their gods, they took the beſt things they had, to caſt into the fire to their gods, but what are Sacrifices and Offerings to him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10. <hi>For every beaſt of the forreſt is mine, and the cattel upon a thouſand hills.</hi> Pſal. 51.16. <hi>For thou deſireſt not ſacriace, elſe would I give it thee, thou delighteſt not in burnt-offerings.</hi> Pſal. 16.2. <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not unto thee.</hi> Micah 6.7. <hi>Shall I give my firſt born for my tranſgreſſim, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> What would all this ſignifie as a price to him? 3. As we cannnot merit, nor give a price, ſo there is no ſervice we can do; there are ſervants that cannot buy nor merit, yet there are ſome pieces of ſervice, by which they may bring an obligation upon their Maſter; but there is no ſervice we can do, that can bring an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him. <hi>Iſaith</hi> 64.6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſs are as filthy rags.</hi> Luke 17.10. <hi>So likewiſe ye, when ye have done all thoſe things which are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> we have done that which was our duty to do. Laſtly, ſuppoſe we have none of theſe three, we might influence a thingfrom God by beauty and comelineſs, and ſuitableneſs to his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but neither can this be: Read the ſixteenth of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ye wil find what he found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he firſt entered in Covenant with her, <hi>Thou waſt cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy perſon, in the day that thou waſt born,</hi> he compares <hi>Iſrael</hi> to a Child new born; as for thy nativity, <hi>in the day that thou waſt born, thy navel was not cut, neither waſt thou waſhed in water to ſupple thee; thou waſt not ſalted at all, nor ſwadled at all,</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>when I paſſed by thee, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirts over thee, and covered thy nakedneſs;</hi> ſo the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:43047:174"/>of Grace running in this ſtrain, we muſt be altogether free from having any acceſſion to it, there is none of us, but we may ſay, although my houſe be not ſo with GOd, when he enters in Covenant with us.</p>
            <p>For further clearing of this, it will appear in theſe three or four Particulars. 1. Take a view of the perſons he takes in Covenant with him, when firſt he meets with them, they are ſometimes ſimpler than other, and ſometime baſer than others, it's not many Wife, not many Noble, but God hath choſen the fooliſh things to confound the wife; ſeveral times when he begins firſt to take them into Covenant, they are in regard of outward priviledges, inferior to others, was not <hi>Eſau Jacob</hi>'s Brother? and the elder Brother? they had the ſame Father and the ſame Mother, and any thing that might be a difference, <hi>Eſau</hi> had it, yet <hi>Jacoh</hi> have I loved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated: the perſons he takes in Covenant, evidence it to be a Covenant of Grace and free favour; ſometime they are the ſimpleſt, ſometime the loweſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time among the groſſeſt of ſinners; what was <hi>Paul?</hi> what was <hi>Mary Magdalen?</hi> 2. It evidences the Covenant to be of meer Grace in regard of us, in that the Lord keeps dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways with them he takes in Covenant, after he takes them in, and yet he does them no wrong, there are ſome he will call at the third hour, ſome at the ſixth hour, ſome at the tenth, ſome at the eleventh, he will give as much to them he calls at the tenth Hour, as to them he calls at the third, he will give as much Glory, and as much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and when he hath done that, he can tell, Friend, I have done thee no wrong I may do with my own what I will; there may be one called in at the gates of Death, that may have as much, nay a greater gale of ſweetneſs, than the old ſtanding Chriſtians ever had; it's remarkable, the good Thief on the Croſs, never man exceeded him in a gale of ſweetneſs, yet he ſearce had it one hour, he had it out of Chriſt's own mouth, this night thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, ſcarce any exceeded him in a fluſh of love, he tells the ill Thief, we are juſtly here, ſays he, but this man what hath he done? and yet he came in at the eleventh hour. So it evidences it's of Grace abſolutely, in regard he will call what perſon he will in, and diſpenſe to them as he pleaſes when they come in, tho they come in at the eleventh
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:43047:174"/>hour, yet he will give them poſſibly a Feaſt, that they that come in at the third hour get not. 3. It evidences it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of us to be of Grace, in that the diſpenſations of the Covenant, they are not only communicat to what perſon, and in what meaſure he pleaſes, but in the third place, their Diſpenſations are limited by no Law, either as to Time, or Place, or Duration, or Continuance under the Covenant of grace; we cannot telll when we will have communion with God, nor how long we will keep it; it will ſometimes come before, we be aware, and it will go before we be aware, the Deſign of it is to prove, that the diſpenſations of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, depends on the Will and good Pleaſure of him that gave them, of take a Believer at his fulleſt, the Covenant is the enjoyment of it, is proven to be of Grace, in regard the thing given, we can have no hand in it, and it goes, and readily he is no finful cauſe of it; ſo theſe are clear evidences, that the Covenant is of meer Grace. This be the firſt ground on which I go, to prove the Covenant to be of Grace.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that on Gods, part, all he does; proves it to be of Grace, might he not have ſaid, that which is filthy, let it be filty ſtill? that which is dying, let it die? after Man had fallen, but he took another way.</p>
            <p>The Grounds on which the-Covenant ſtands, and the foundations Divines make, are three, and all the three are to be found in him; the firſt is, his Love; the ſecond is, his Chriſt; the third, his Mercy; theſe three are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations on which the Covenant ſtands, and they all prove it to be of free Grace. 1. There is his Love, it's ſo much the ſweether, that love is at the bottom of it, if the Father give a Jewel to his Son, but if he give it with a frown, or a token of anger, it would not be ſo much, as if he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Farthing, with all the Teſtimonies of his Heart-love; but here we have a Jewed, and we have it with no frown; it's remarkable, Deut. 7.7. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love on you, nor chooſe you, becauſe ye were moe in number than any people,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>But becauſe the Lord loved you, and becauſe he would keep the oath which he had ſworn to your fathers:</hi> Now, heard ye ever ſuch a becauſe as this ? I have loved you, becauſe I have loved you. What Logick would this appear to <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> would they not call it an Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick?
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:43047:175"/>but this holds well in the point of the Covenant, I have loved you, becauſe I have loved you; ſo that there is the firſt riſe of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> it's love, and if ye ſay, what was the riſe of the Love? was it Beauty? was it Service? Merit? or Price? no, it was Love, I have loved you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I loved you. 2. The great foundation of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is his Chriſt; therefore the <hi>Covenant</hi> is called, the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> now <hi>David</hi> was dead long before <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s time; <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, ſays he, in the latter days, that</hi> David <hi>my ſervant ſhal be their King, David</hi> was dead, but there were two <hi>Davids,</hi> and like the ſecond Temple, the glory of the latter Temple, was greater than the firſt; now the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> are the ſure mercies of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which are called ſo, becauſe they are ſounded on Chriſt, whoſe Type <hi>David</hi> was, and he a Branch ſprung out of the root of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> 3. The <hi>Covenant</hi> is founded on his Mercy, that ye may diſtinguiſh from his love, Mercy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes miſery; the proper object of Mercy is miſery: we may rather call the ground of the <hi>Covenant</hi> Pity, <hi>I had pity on them for my own names ſake,</hi> it's not love that inclines ſome to be favourable to them that are in miſery, but pity, the ſame was at the root of the Covenant, he ſaw many to be created and born, and knew they would eternally ruine, and out of pity he entered into this Covenant.</p>
            <p>For further clearing and confirming of this point, that the <hi>Covenant</hi> is abſolutely of Grace and free Favour, I would have you take a view of the Bleſſings of the Covenant, the conditions of the Conenant, and thirdly of the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Covenant; and all theſe three will evidence it, to be a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace. 1. Take a view of the Bleſſings of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> if ye will but view them in their greatneſs, that God ſhould be our God, that Chriſt ſhould be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, that we ſhould have Pardon, Peace, Fellewſhip and Heaven, readily we could neither Merit, nor give Peace, nor Service, but ſome trivial thing in time, but what could we do for Heaven? if there were no more to make Popery odious, that is enought, that they plead for merit, they that will plead for Juſtification by Works; there ſeems to be ſome Magick in them. 2. If ye view the Conditions or Terms, on which they are made, it's impoſſible that there could be an Offer made, but upon ſome terms, unleſs God
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:43047:175"/>would bring all to glory, both the Reprobate and Profane, and the Godly, he behoved to make ſome terms, and it was impoſſible for him to make them lower, than to accept of, believe in, and imprace the Son. 3. If ye view the end of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which is the exalting of the glory of his Grace; ſince the beginning of the World, he hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his power in his Government of the World, and in the end, he will exalt his Juſtice; but here in making this <hi>Covenant,</hi> he hath exalted his Grace: ſo ye ſee this <hi>Covenant</hi> clear, that it is meerly of Grace.</p>
            <p>Before I clear any Objection againſt it, I would inqure into the Reaſons, why the Lord would have this <hi>Covenant,</hi> abſolutely of Grace and free Favour; many reaſons are brought by them that treat of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> but I will pitch on three or four. 1. The Lord would have it a <hi>Covenant</hi> of meer Grace, that is might be ſure; it could ſtand on no Foundation without tottering, but on his Grace, <hi>therefore it is of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.16. <hi>That it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed;</hi> that which makes the <hi>Covenant</hi> ſure is, that it ſtands on God's Grace; the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works ſtood on <hi>Adam</hi>'s free will, it's true he had an excellent qualified will, and abundance of power, and con-creted greace too, in as great a meaſure as he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, yet when it ſtood on <hi>Adam</hi>'s inherent grace, it could not be ſure. but now it ſtands on Gods, grace, ſo that Gods grace muſt fail, before the Covenant fail, why? he hath made it ſtand on the foundation of Chriſt, and ſo long as Grace endures, the <hi>Covenant</hi> endures, 2. As he hath made it ſure to them that do not deſerve it, ſo he hath made it a Covenant of Grace, that he might make all the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it inexcuſable, <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken to them them had not had ſin, but now they have no cloke for their ſin:</hi> he might have come and ſpoken the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works, and that readily would not have taken away all excuſes form them, but Chriſt came and ſpake the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, and if he came and ſpoke it, what cloke can be invented for ſin, and rejecting of Chriſt in the <hi>Covenant?</hi> ye are told, he will forgive all by-gones, if ye be but willing, and thought ye have a mixture of unwillingneſs, yet if ye come with that unwillingneſs, and accept of his Offer, he will forgive; does not this take away all excuſes? what excuſe can the ſinner
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:43047:176"/>have, and imagine to have, at the great day, when a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of grace is offered to him, and yet he rejects it? 3. it's of grace, to keep the godly humble, it keeps them humble, if ye take a view of three things, that are brought under th <hi>Covenant.</hi> 1. The time was, when they were like the worſt of ſinners, there is not one piece of Clay in the hole of the pit, not one ſtone in the Quarrie, but they are like other, <hi>Jacob</hi> is like <hi>Eſau</hi> in the hole of the pit. 2. Any thing that hath made the difference betwixt a Believer and a Reprobate, it's a thing given, <hi>What haſt thou that thou hast not received? and if thou hast received it, why boaſts thou as if thou had not received it?</hi> they are alike in natures, and any defference there is, it's but as ye ſaw on a wall, there is one place of the eall dark, and on another place there is a ray of the Sun, that ray came not from the wall, but from the Sun, and if there be an Interpoſtion, it will be as dark as any other place in the Wall, and this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to keep them humble. 3. The Lord would have this <hi>Covenant</hi> to be of grace, that he might exalt his Son, and there is indeed the great Reaſon of it, the Father intended to exalt the humane nature of the perſon of the Mediator, that is one Deſign, like the Dream <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaw in the Fields, I dreamed, ſays he, that all your Sheafs fell down, and mine ſtood up; this Dream the Father accompliſhes in the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of grace, he would have yours and mine, and all our Sheaves fall down, and Chriſts ſtand up; the exalting of him is well payed for, he merited it, does he not deſerve it:? the exalting of his Son is one great Deſign he hath, in preſerving and governing of the World, for he hath done him, beſides the love he had to him, a wonderful piece of ſervice; that it is a wonder to be conſidered; ſo that the <hi>Covenant</hi> might be ſure, that it might make the Be probate inexcuſable for rejecting of him, and make Believers hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet exalt Chriſt, it's made a <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace. Laſtly, he would have it a <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, that there might run a conſiderable difference, betwixt it and the old <hi>Covenant</hi> of Works; I deny not, but there was grace in that <hi>Covenant,</hi> but it was nothing to this; theſe Reaſons do ſufficiently evince, why the Lord would have this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> There is one only Objection I will anſwer, May
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:43047:176"/>not ſome ſay, did not our Cautioner purchaſe this Covenant? and in a legal ſenſe, what the Cautioner hath payed, the Principal hath payed, as to all uſes of the Law, the Act of the Cautioner is to be imputed to the principal Debitor, and if the Cautioner hath payed, how can it be a Covenant of grace and free favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection will be taken away, if ye notice three things, 1. It was Grace that made the Father give Chriſt; was ever the like of it heard tell of, a Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son, and loving him ſo well, and giving him for his enemy? would that derogat any thing from Grace? I like the Obſervation of a Divine, he ſays, there are many gracious promiſes in the Covenant, but the Kernel of the grace of them lies, in giving Chriſt; of all the wonderful acts that ever was heard tell of, the like of this was never heard, that the Father ſhojld bive Chriſt; it's true <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offered to give his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was commanded, and he had done a great ſin, if he had refuſed; beſide, he knew well that God was able to raiſe up an <hi>Iſaac</hi> out of his Aſhes; ſo that is was of grace he gave his Son. 2. It was grace, that he accepted his Son; I confeſs the ſacrfice he offered, was of infinit va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but the Law porvided, that the perſon that ſinned ſhould die. and he was not the perſon that ſinned: it's a great wonder, that he accepted from any other, but from the perſon that ſinned. 3. The glorifying the Mediator for the ſatisfaction, was a great act of grace. Remember ye an Obſervation I had, the laſt time we had the Communion on that Text, <hi>Come to the Wedding, all things are ready;</hi> ye heard, the difficult things were put by hand, not only the decrees of Election, but the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is put by hand, neither could God, nor Man, nor Angels ſatisfie for us, 1. God could not ſatisfie, for he was not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſinned; Angels could not do it, upon the ſame ground; and Man could not give a ſatisfaction of infinit value, How ſhould it be done then? He muſt be both God and Man in one perſon; what a difficult paſs was this? he muſt be God to overcome, and Man to die; and ſo ye ſee, that Chriſt hath payed the Debt, and purchaſed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and this derogats nothing from the grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but rather confirms it to be of grace.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Doeth not the Covenant of grace injoin the whole Law, how can it them be called a Covenant of ſuch intire grace? nay more, ye have heard, there are things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in it, that are not commanded in the Covenant of Works? how can it then be a Covenant of meer grace and favour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For opening, I deſire ye may notice three or four particulars. 1. Obedience to the Law, is not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal condition of the Covenant of grace, believing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of Chriſt, is the principal command and condition of it, nay juſtifying Faith; however there be ſome in this generation, would fain put in love in the definition of faith, either deſigning a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi> errour, they know not, that Faith is the principal condition, and that as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, though it cannot be ſeparat from Works, they go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably togegher, yet in its nature and eſſence, it doeth not include them. 2. I add, though the Covenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Law, and enjoin it, yet it does not enjoin it as a thing to be performed in our ſtrength, <hi>Adam</hi> was to obey it by the ſtrength of inherent Grace, but we are to obey it in the ſtrength of aſſiſting Grace; there is a Theſaurer appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Who is made of the Father, our wiſdom, ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> a very neceſſar Truth to be obſerved; ſome
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43047:177"/>when they go about duties, they would wring them out of their own hearts, and do them in their won ſtrength, that agrees not to the nature of the Covenant, the way how we are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law is, to abide in Chriſt, and bring out ſtrength out of him, and the more we depend on him, and the oftner we come to him we are the welcomer; he readily gives more than we ask, he will do as <hi>Naaman</hi> did with <hi>Gehaſi,</hi> as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves well, <hi>Gehaſi</hi> running after <hi>Naaman,</hi> he asks a Talent of him, <hi>I pray thee,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be content, take two;</hi> we bake beſide Meal, and have a Theſaurer to bear our Purſe, and to defray our expenſe. in every Inns, and in every ſtrait we come to. <hi>3ly.</hi> Though the Covennat command the Law, yet it will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the will for the deed, and ſincerity for perfection; it was not ſo under the Covenant of Works, where it was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>He that offends in the leaſt, is guilty of all;</hi> but in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, though we be commanded to be perfect, yet there will be acceptation of uprightneſs for perfection, <hi>4ly,</hi> Obedience to the Law is indeed commanded, but not to be our Righteouſneſs; it would have been <hi>Adams</hi> Righteouſneſs, had he ſtood under the Covenant of Works, but this cannot be commanded in order to our Juſtification; there is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs accepted, and that is one of the reaſons, why the Lord in the Covenant of Grace accepts of leſs, than under the Covenant of Works; He firſt conſiders our lapſid eſtate, then he doth with us, as a man that hath a great Sun owing him, by a Creditor, he gets ſo much from the Cautioner, that he is content to accept of leſs from the Principal; all that God could expect, was from <hi>Adams</hi> ſelf, his Bond admitted not of a Cautioner; but under the Covenant of Grace, there is leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at our hand, that there is ſo much done by the Caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo it does not overturn the Truch of the Covenant, that this Covenant is abſolutely free, and a full Act of free Grace, though there be a commanding of the Law in it.</p>
            <p>Without inſiſting more on the Doctrinal part, I will come to the practical uſe of it. 1. Is this Covenant a Covenant of ſo free Grace and Favour, made with thoſe whoſe houſe is not ſo with God? Is it a Covenant thus of meer Grace? The motives and grounds are not derived from us, but from ſomething in God himſelf: it ſerves for ſeveral practical improvements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt, I would exhort you to take heed of making the wrong Uſe of it, ſo as to abuſe this Doctrine of free Grace,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43047:178"/>two or three ſorts of people come under the abuſe of it. 1. Such as take liberty to ſin, they abuſe it, to take Grace, and make it a prop to ſin, is an abuſe of Grace; <hi>God forbid.</hi> ſays <hi>Paul, that we ſhould ſin, that Grace may abound;</hi> I like the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation a Divine hath, he ſays, there cannot be a greater wrong done to an honeſt ingenuous man, than to ſay, he is an encourager to Drunkenneſs, to Swearing, to Adultery, to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to Lying, what a reflection muſt it be on Chriſt, to ſay, that his Covenant is not of Grace. <hi>2ly.</hi> All they that live in any known ſin, and are cheriſhing themſelves with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace, they abuſe it; it is a Covenant of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but as ye heard, <hi>It's ordered in all things;</hi> ye cannot plead the conditional Promiſes, before ye make uſe of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſes. <hi>3ly</hi> Such as are pleading for pardon without repentance, they are abuſing this Dectrine of Grace, and there cannot be a greater injury done to Chriſt; he hath mediat and treated this Covenant, and ordered it in all things; it's one of the great fruits of the deep of his Wiſdom, and to go to abuſe it, is a great wrong. <hi>4ly.</hi> All ye that live careleſs, ignorant, ſecure, and ſcandalous under the Goſpel, and are always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Grace, and a Covenant of Grace, know, that to all your other guilt readily this may be added, as the capeſtone, that ye turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs, and fall aſleep in your guilt, on this pillow, that this Covenant was free; therefore, whatever hath been ſaid of Grace, as free, ſtand by all ye that are living in any known ſin, and golrying in Grace, and makes no uſe of Chriſt for Repentance; whatever encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I have in commiſſion to thee, that deſires to feed on the Covenant, it's the Childs Bread; therefore let the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtand by; and the latter, take your own allowance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Is this Covenant of Grace? It ſerves for Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it informs of four or five remarkable things. 1. Of the great condeſcendency of Gods Grace, he had made a Covenant with <hi>Aaam.</hi> the perfecteſt meer man that ever was, when God mad a Covenant with him, he broke it; in the eſtate of Innocency, it was made with him, was it not a wonder, that ever he ſhould have thought upon any other way with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man, when perfect man could not keep it; yet when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Covenant was broken, and after the Bond, we had failed, He immediatly thinks on another Covenant, and that to run in the channel of Grace; it's remarkable, man was lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43047:178"/>and fallen, readily any then would have made it a ground of contradiction, which he turned up into an Argument of pity; O! the condeſcendency of Grace, O! the height, the depth, the breadth of his love; ye ſhould be admiring his love, and ſometime ſpeaking of it one to another; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had broken one Covenant he would immediatly think of making another, and that founded on Grace, that it might be ſure, it's of Grace, that it may be ſure.</p>
            <p>Will ye be exhorted to be more in the meditation of this Grace, will ye ſpeak often to one another, when ye have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the condeſcendency of his Grace; why ſhould all your diſcourſes run, in complaints of miſery and difficulties, and not more in commending this admirable Grace, that manifeſted it ſelf, when we had broken that Covenant, to enter in another, and found it on Grace. <hi>2ly.</hi> Is this Covenant a Covenant of Grace? Then it informs, of what is the ground, on which ſtands our enjoying the priviledges of the Covenant: I like well the Obſervation of a Divine, he ſays, it's a neceſſar work for a Chriſtian, to ſit down, and confider, whence is it that one hath effectual calling, and another wants it? What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have pardon, and another will never get it? And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times what is the reaſon, that I am not in the lake, and left not to be tormented for ever and ever? Would thou know the reaſon, it's Grace, and meer Grace, how neceſſar is it for us, when we take up the Covenant as a Covenant of Grace, to be conſidering, that all our Mercies privative and poſitive, what we are keeped from, and what we enjoy, they come all from Grace? For the Covenant is a Covenant of Grace. Were we ſerious in pondering this, it would put a luſter on our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the ſmell of Grace would add a great deal of ſweetheſs to them. <hi>2ly.</hi> It would make us uſe them very humbly, what mercy has thou? Grant it be Prayer, or the Spirit of Prayer; thou holds it of Grace, and allenarly of Grace; it's Grace, and Grace only, that hath put the difference betwixt thee and him; it's no wonder, that of all Chriſtians, thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be the moſt humble, for when they come to glory, and hath on their Sundays Cloaths, Grace, Grace will be cryed to be the Capeſtone; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, if we merited not Heaven, we would not be ſo glorious in Heaven; ſays one, to whom is the glory to be given? The diſtinguiſhing Grace, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, the many privative and poſitive Mercies, will be
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43047:179"/>the ground of our Song, therefore take up a Catalogue, both of what thou has, and what thou hopes for, and give the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Grace. <hi>3ly.</hi> It informs upon what warrantable ground we may want for the Calling, nay, for the Glory, even of the moſt wretched; it's true, if our effectual calling were to be merited, if our pardon were to be bought, we might give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all hope; but ſince they come by Grace, the Glory is to be aſcribed to Grace; there are three things in this Grace, that may warrantably make the ſoul hope. I Grace ſtands upon no bygones, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt excepted; if thou were never ſo groſs a ſinner, if thou come and accept the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Chriſt, as he is held out in this Covenant, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to paſs all bygones. <hi>2ly.</hi> This Grace ſtands not at the weakneſs of Parts, nor the meanneſs of Qualificatious; no, Babes and Sucklings, and things that are not, Grace will prevent them, and paſs by them. <hi>3ly.</hi> Grace ſtands not at the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, even though it have ſome mixture of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I <hi>believe, help my unbelied,</hi> ſaid the poor man; ſo thou may warrantably go to God, and pray for ſuch a friend, that is living, and may be ſees not the danger of his natural State, and thou thinks he is ſo gone, as that he is incurable; thou knows not that thou haſt to do with a good God, who is the foundation of the Covenant of Grace; readily ye will ſay, what ground of hope? There is a Covenant of Grace, that is founded neither upon merit, nor price, nor ſervice, but alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly Gods Grace. Theſe Uſes of Information, and ſeveral others, I will not inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Is this Covenant ſo free, and of Grace? then it ſerves for Exhortation; Be exhorted to improve it, as a Covenant of Grace; frequently Believers deal with themſelves, as if they were often under a Covenant of Works, and hence it is their conſolation is no way anſwerable to their allowance; ſeveral times, they are like Children beſide a full breaſt, the Child is lying, and it's lean, and ill like, all the members of the Body of it are decaying, the reaſon is, not becauſe the Nurſe hath not a full Breaſt, but the Child wants the art of ſucking.</p>
            <p>Therefore I will here preſs on Believers theſe two things. 1. I would exhort you to take up this Covenant, as a Covenant of Grace. <hi>2ly.</hi> I exhort you to improve it as a Covenant of Grace. 1. Take it up as a Covenant of Grace, and that ye may do this, two things I will only recommend unto you.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43047:179"/>1. Conſider, God intended abſolutely to alter the nature of the firſt Covenant, when he made the ſecond; in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God required perfect obedience, he would not admit of a Cautioner, nor of the leaſt failing; were we under the Covenant of Works, there is not the leaſt failing, nor the leaſt idle word, but we might ſit down and conclude, it will eternally caſt me in hell, for I am under a Covenant that binds me to damnation, for the leaſt tailing; but the nature of the Covenant is altered, and if ye would take up the Covenant of Grace aright, labour to underſtand the difference betwixt the Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of Works, that thou may not go ay judging thy caſe, as if the nature of the Covenant were not changed, but as if thou were under thet Covenant, which is impoſſible for thee to obey. <hi>2ly</hi> Not only underſtand the differences betwixt theſe two Covenants, but exaine theſe four things that I have often mentioned, the principle from which it flows, and that is Love and Grace; the prive that was given for it, &amp; that is the Blood of his Son; the great contents of it, ye have often heard, that it's impoſſible for him, (to ſpeak with reverence) to promiſe greater things than he hath done in the Covenant, he hath promiſed Himſelf and his Son; and <hi>4ly,</hi> conſider the end of it, and that is for the Glory of his Grace, the end of it is, that ye may exalt his Grace; and ſo if ye would take up the Covenant a right, do not only ſtate it in competition with the Covenant of Works, but conſider it in theſe four that are laſt mentioned. In the ſecond place, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort thee to improve it as the Covenant of Grace; I ſhall firſt ſhew you, who are they that do not improve. And <hi>2ly.</hi> Give ſome directions how to improve it as a Covenant of Grace. There are three or four ſorts of perſons, that do not improve it as a Covenant of Grace. I. However we hold in diſput on this head, preparatory Works, to be in Gods ordinary way, antecedent and introductory to converſion, yet we determine not the degrees of preparatory humiliation, no, there is ſome times the Lord opens the heart of a <hi>Lydia,</hi> and we read nothing of his Low Work before; ſome may reaſon, my work is not of effectual calling, why? I had never the legal humiliation that ſome hath; but what if he let out thy Byll with a Prin, and take a Sword to others? What if he carry on thy work of humiliation with thee, in the progreſs of Sanctification? What if thy Legal Terrours be before thee, that ſome have
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:43047:180"/>had in the beginning of their work? He is an abſolute Lord, that hath the overſight of this, thou that will ſit and queſtion all thy foundation marks. O! I was not humbled, the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory works was not with me as with others; however we maintain preparatory works againſt <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that deny them utterly, they ſay, to what purpoſe are they? We main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a neceſſity of them, in ſo far as the Lord bring; the work of converſion after them, as neceſſarily as the Threed muſt follow the Needle But <hi>2ly.</hi> They do not rightly improve this Covenant, hat would make up a hatchpotch, betwixt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace; readily there are ſome, they would lay ſome ſtreſs on Mercy and Grace, providing they had ſome works to mingle in with their Grace; I formerly hinted at it, it's impoſſible to be under both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and thou that would make up a hatchpoton of theſe Covenants, in order to thy Juſtification, thou art taking a way to mingle both together, and they will never wall well. <hi>3ly.</hi> They rightly improve not this Covenant of Grace that ordinarily reject the offers, as either being too far above them, or too far below them; ſeveral Believers, when they are called by the Goſpel to come in to the Banqueting-houſe, they would be at ſome merit or price of their own, before they can treat with Jeſus, about their pardon and their peace, theſe take not up the Covenant as a Covenant of Grace, and are not improving it as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I will offer four Directions, eſpecially relating to four practical caſes, wherein Believers ought to improve the Covenant, as a Covenant of Grace. 1. When under the ſenſe of unworthineſs; O! ſuch a ſilly heart as I have, and what can I do with it? Shall I go to God with it? Wilt thou take up the Covenant as a Covenant of Grace? I have ſeveral times adviſed you to do with Chriſt, as the Father did with him, the Father in the Covenant of Redemption, forgave him not one farthing, he payed it to the utmoſt, for he knew he was abundantly able, therefore he took pleaſure to bruiſe him, therefore he required all that he had promiſed, and on the terms promiſed; ſo if he hath bidden thee come, and get the change of an unworthy heart, and told thee, that unworthineſs is an argument of pity, do not ſit down in the Lond of Famine, as <hi>Jacob's</hi> Children were ready to do in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> even when <hi>Joſeph</hi> hath the Command of all the Store in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:43047:180"/>and if thou ſhould go down with money in thy hand, to buy victuals, he will ſend thee home, and the money in thy ſacks mouth. <hi>2ly.</hi> It's an ordinary caſe, when we come under chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, to ſay, there is no hope for me in God, what will ye ſay of Pardon, hath he not promiſed Pardon? But ſay they, will he pardon the like of me? Will he not pardon the like of thee? He hath pardoned as great ſinners; What made him pardon <hi>David, Abraham, Manaſſeh, Paul,</hi> but Grace? And that ſame Sun that ſhined in their days, ſhines now in our days: and that ſame Grace that was then, is to the fore yet. <hi>3ly.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, when thou goes to God with any Petition, though it be ſome great thing, may be thy heart is broken, under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of the Church of God, the grace of the Covenant may be a great encouragement to thee in that caſe, though thou think, O! ſuch an undeſerving thing as I am, and what can Grace do but caſt me off? But thou may go conſidently to him, if it be for thy ſelf, if for thy friend in diſtreſs, if for the Church of God; and though thou have no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou may preſs the Grace of the Covenant. Laſtly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Grace in the judging of Fundamental Priviledges, and in the building of thy hopes of eternal ones; Firſt, Thy Adoption comes to be a Queſtion, what? An I adopted to be a Son of God? A poor thing? But what could that hinder the Grace of the Covenant, if Grace thought fit to call thee to that Priviledge? Theſe that are ready to think on ſuch great things, what is in my walk? Shall I enjoy God for all eternity? How can it be expected, that I ſhall enjoy him? But Grace is the great ground of all our hopes; to be brief, learn to take up this Covenant, as a Covenant of Grace, and to deal with himſelf according to it, there are none of you, but in a little while, ye will be at the gates of death, and this will be the great ground of your encouragement.</p>

The laſt Uſe is of Conſolation, I would from this, have Believers encouraged; there are three great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ye have from it. 1. If ye be in Chriſt, his Grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, all your provocations cannot exhauſt it, if ye be in Chriſt, it's like a man would take a Miln-ſtone, and caſt in the Sea, the Sea will cover the Miln-ſtone, as well as it will do a little peeble ſtone, the greateſt provocations will ſink in this Grace, as well as the ſmall ones; it's true, if thou take occaſion and ſleep ſecure on this cod of Grace, it ſhall be an aggravation
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43047:181"/>of thy former guilt; but if thou be a penitent, this Grace will cover it, though it were great, as if it were ſmall; therefore be encouraged, all that take them to this Grace, in its due Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Grace of it is infinit. <hi>2ly.</hi> Ordinarly it's the nature of Grace, the more miſerable the Object be, the more Grace is manifeſted, and appears, in that it did Terminat on that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the more wretched, the more Grace hath appeared in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that wretchedneſs ſo that God deſigns to exalt his Grace in this Covenant, and the more wretched and miſerable, the more will Grace appear; Grace hath ſhined brighter, and hath the more of Grace into it, that it did Terminat on the like of <hi>Paul, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and a <hi>Manaſſeh. 3ly.</hi> Conſider, that one Act of his Grace is a pledge of another, if the Lord hath begun to give thee preventing Grace in thy effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, know the nature of this Covenant, and the Grace of it, it will not ſtop there, until this Crown glorifie thee; if the Lord hath brought thee under this Covenant of Grace, and if he hath begun to prevent thee, and carry on a work of Grace in thee, it will never ſtop, until it cloſe in perfecting Grace, and have the Crown ſet upon thy head. Let us bleſs the Lord, that hath changed one Covenant, and hath given us another, wherein the greateſt Teſtimonies of Grace that could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are manifeſted; take your ſelves to it, and labour to improve it, and get an intereſt in it ſecured, and ye ſhall find the comfort of it through all Eternity.</p>

            <p>I Have dwelt the moſt part of this Summer on this Verſe, and purpoſes to cloſe it this day; there are two Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one taken from <hi>David</hi>'s guilt, <hi>My houſe is not ſo with God,</hi> another taken from God's Providence, <hi>Although he make it not to grow;</hi> The firſt of theſe I have handled in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43047:181"/>Sermons, and told you what was meaned by <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe, it was not right with God. There are two Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remains, and both of them Native, and very Important. Firſt, There is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>That Challenges for guilt of our houſe, are excellently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Covenant;</hi> the Application of the Covenant, is the proper Salve for ſuch Sores; I intended to have handled this Truth at ſome length, but when I conſider that famous Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> in his <hi>Therapeutica,</hi> a Book he hath written for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all Caſes by Application of this Covenant, hath handled this ſo fully, that I reſolve to forbear; I recommend only that Book to you, where ye will find many diſeaſes the Soul is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, and they are all cured, by Application of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; it's not this Truth then that I will inſiſt on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. There is another Obſervation lies in this, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, That though a Believer be challenged for guilt, and the ſins of his houſe, yet he is not to caſt at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> The ſenſe of guilt ought not to put a Chriſtian to caſt at the Covenant, <hi>Though my houſe be not ſo with God,</hi> yet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> can aſſert his intereſt in the Covenant, notwithſtanding of all his guilt, perſonal or publick, or in his Family: This is a native Truth and maſſie, ye have a remarkable confirmation of it, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9.32. throughout the Chapter, he is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſins of the Kings, of the Princes, of the Prieſts, of the Prophets, of his Fathers, and of the People; and yet in this <hi>verſe</hi> he appeals to God, as their God, <hi>Now therefore, O our God, the great, the mighty and the terrible God, who keepeth Covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble ſeem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our Kings, on our Princes, on our Prieſts, and on our Prophets, and on our Fathers, and on all thy People, ſince the time of the Kings of Aſsyria, unto this day,</hi> &amp;c. There a multitude of ſins that are confeſſed by him, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Chapter, and he looks on God as Mighty and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet none of them dings him from the Covenant; whatever be the ſmell of our guilt, or of our Family, yet we are not to caſt at the Covenant.</p>
            <p>I will in following this truth, ſpeak a little to theſe three things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall give you ſome grounds to prove, that whatever be a perſons guilt, yet they are not to caſt at the Covenant. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall clear ſome practical Caſes about it; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſhall apply it.</p>
            <pb n="356" facs="tcp:43047:182"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall give you ſome grounds to prove, that whatever be a ſinners guilt, he is not to caſt at the Covenant, though my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; I will offer you theſe five remarkable grounds to prove it; The firſt I take from God, and there are three things in God relating to the Covenant, that will prove the truth of this. 1. For all our guilt God holds the Covenant firm, guilt caſts us not out of the Covenant, it may caſt us out of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that will not caſt us out of the Covenant. Jer. 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Return, backſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married to you;</hi> there the Covenant holds firm, and ſince God holds the Covenant firm under guilt, we may warrantably plead the Covenant, even though we be guilty of many ſins. <hi>2ly.</hi> When people are guilty, God makes them offer of the Covenant. Iſa 1.18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> Pſal. 68. <hi>Though ye have layen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pots, ye ſhall appear as doves,</hi> &amp;c. And ſince God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Covenant, when we are moſt guilty, may not we warrantably rely on it? <hi>3ly.</hi> God hath given experience in Scripture; of his accompliſhing his Covenant to them, whoſe houſe were not ſo with God; the great Inſtances we have in <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who are now walking in long white Robes in Glory, they all prove, that he holds faſt and accompliſhes his Covenant, though their houſe be not ſo with God. All theſe laid together, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and are the firſt ground of the point, that when we come to be challenged for guilt, yet we may warrantably rely on, and plead the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The ſecond ground is this, though it be true the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be a created thing, it's finit, yet the riſe and Seals of it are infinit; there is nothing properly infinit, but allanerly God, and conſequently the Covenant is finit, mercy is the riſe of it, and truth is the ſeal of it, and they are eſſential At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God; ſo, though the Covenant and Promiſes be created things, (though though they be finit) yet the fountain of the Promiſes, and the Seals of them are infinit; now what ever guilt thy ſoul can be challenged for, thou has ſomething that's infinit in the Covenant, the riſe and ſeal of it cannot but be for finit guilt, a ſufficient ground of relying on infinit
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43047:182"/>mercy and truth; if <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſtand and ſay, Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I have denyed him, if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, Chriſts righteouſneſs, I have blaſphemed; his righteouſneſs will not cover my ſin; that which is ſufficient to cover the ſins of all the elect, is ſufficient to cover the ſins of any particular elect; there is ground under challenges to rely on the Covenant, the mercy of it is infinit, and the truth whereby it's ſealed is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit. <hi>3ly.</hi> The great end for which God challenges for guilt is, to drive ſinners to the Covenant; it's the great end for which he challenges and tells the perſon, my houſe is not ſo with God, it's not to drive them from the Covenant, but to it; the Law in this caſe becomes a School-maſter to lead to Chriſt; of all the Logick that ever I read, it was the worſt in <hi>Peter</hi> to ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man;</hi> he had rather ground to ſay, come to me, for he was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of ſinners, and he had his Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> on that ſcore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaves his people from their ſins. Now, to ſay, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> to him, the caſe is ſo, as when we ſay, our houſe is not ſo with God, and I cannot take the Covenant; the mo challenges, the greater need of the Covenant; and here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when challenges and terrours are impediments to faith, they are like <hi>Jordan,</hi> flowing over all its Banks, they are never kept in their proper limits, but when they rely on the Covenant, and the mercy and truth, that are the ſprings and ſeals of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> Take notice of this, as one ground of the truth of this, that challenges and guilt ſhould not drive us from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but to the Covenant; ordinarily a rejecting of mercy, is a diſmal ſin; hardly is there a greater injury done to Chriſt, than when challenges, or ſenſe of guilt, puts us to caſt at his mercy, and his Covenant; I like the Divinity of one, that tells, <hi>Judas</hi> did Chriſt a great wrong in betraying him, but a far greater in deſpairing of his mercy; in betraying him he laboured to take away Chriſts life as man, but in deſpairing of his mercy, he laboured to take away the life of God; there is no greater ſin, than when we caſt at his mercy; it is deſpair, to entertain challenges and dwell on them, and not rely on the Covenant; now deſpair of all ſins againſt God, it's one of the moſt helliſh like, and one of the greateſt ſins: I will let you ſee four evils that ly in this ſin of deſpair, and are peculiar to it. 1. Deſpair oppoſes God in his greateſt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43047:183"/>Commands, the greateſt Command that ever he gave, was to believe in his Son, 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Christ;</hi> now deſpair is unbelief in the higheſt degree, therefore it oppoſes God in his greateſt Commands. <hi>2ly.</hi> It oppoſes God in one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his chiefeſt Attributes, the great end why he made the world, was not to be glorified in his Power, in his Wiſdom, in his Juſtice, but in his Mercy and his Grace, there is the great end of Creation and Providence, that he may be exalted i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Mercy and his Grace, and deſpair oppoſes him in this. <hi>3ly.</hi> Deſpair it enrages the ſoul againſt God, the damned in Hell that are deſpairing of Chriſts mercy, are weeping and howling, and gnaſhing their teeth, they would even bite God if they could reach him; they are compared to a Dog gnaſhing his teeth, in the place of the damned, there is nothing to be heard there, but howling, and curſing, and gnaſhing of teeth, and that for ever and ever; the reaſon is, they deſpair of Chriſts mercy: had they hope after a million of years to come to glory, they would lay by their howling and curſing but that hope is paſt them, the door is cloſed and they are enraged, and fighting deſperatly, and none fights ſo deſperatly, as Souldiers that expects no Quarters. <hi>4ly</hi> Deſpair makes every ſin unpardonable; the ſmalleſt ſin committed in the courſe of our life, becomes an unpardonable ſin, if it be venomed with the venome of deſpair, ſo ye ſee deſpair, of all ſins is moſt dreadful, and moſt diſmal to God, and he that caſts at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant when he is challenged for guilt, muſt deſpair, and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently diſhonour God <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We are not to caſt at the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in regard there is no way of an outgate from challenges, but from the Covenant; let folk turn themſelves where they will under terrours, there is no way of an outgate but from the Covenant, and readily they that ſeek their contentment in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and caſt at the comforts of God under their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, they are driven to ſeek an outgate in their luſts; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Paſſage of famous Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon,</hi> having one day to deal with a perſon under the terrours of God, with whom he had been ſeveral times, he made offer of the Covenant to him, but the man did caſt at all the offers of the Covenant, and was overwhelmed with terrours, and after ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he pleaded with him thus, ſays he, if ye ſtubbornly refuſe the comforts of God, ye ſhall at length ſeek your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43047:183"/>in your luſts; and a little after, the man turned profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, and continued profligat and prophane. Now lay all theſe together, and ye will ſee the truth of the point, that when God challenges for guilt, it's not our part to caſt at the Covenant, but the more firmly to adhere and cleave to it and aſſert an intereſt in it.</p>
            <p>Before I apply it, there are two caſes I will clear; <hi>Firſt,</hi> one may ask, Shall every one under challenges, lay claim to the Covenant? There may be a twofold difficulty here: <hi>First,</hi> I am not ſufficiently humbled to lay claim to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, great ſins ſhould have great repentance; <hi>Manaſseh</hi> was a great ſinner, and the Scripture ſays, he humbled himſelf greatly before God; Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> readily one may ſay, I come ſhort of grief for ſin, and of the tears that an hypocrite will have, and ſhall I lay claim to the Covenant, and aſſert an intereſt in it?</p>
            <p>For removing of theſe, the truth of this will hold, that when we come to be challenged for guilt, we are not to run from the Covenant, but to rely on it, and aſſert an intereſt in it; this Objection overturns not the truth of the point; For 1. There is a twofold ſuitableneſs of humiliation unto the ſins we have committed, there is a Legal humiliation, and an Evangelick; a Legal humiliation requires an exact proportion of repentance, to the degree and meaſure of the ſin; an Evangelick humiliation requires a ſincere and upright repentance; now, when we come to be challenged for guilt, and we would ſtand at embracing the Covenant, upon the account there is no ſuitable humiliation to the ſin, conſider, it's true, if it be an unſuitable Evangelick humiliation, that is not ſincere, thou cannot plead the Covenant, but though it be not legal humiliation, thou may plead the Covenant. A man in his grief for ſin, before he come to plead the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he ſhould do as a man coming to a deep Water, O! ſaith he, I will drown before I come to the middle of it, therefore he caſts about to ſee if he can get a Bridge; the truth is, the Goſpel-ſuitableneſs is a Bridge to a Legal ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs; many take the Water, and ask not the way to the Bridge, therefore their terrours diſtract them, and it is as it were the beginning of Hell to them. But I add <hi>2ly.</hi> A hypocrite may have mo terrours when they are humbled, and poſſibly more joy at another time, than a ſound belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will have, for terrours and joy are but pendicles of Grace,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:43047:184"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> of their Faith, Love, and Delight in God, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of the great Graces of the Spirit; a Hypocrite may out ſtrip a ſound Believer in terrours, and flaſhes of joy, but they cannot out-ſtrip them in believing, loving, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God; certainly <hi>Judas</hi> ſorrow for ſin, when he hanged himſelf, as to the degree, was greater than <hi>Peters.</hi> I like the diſtinction Divines have, betwixt terrours of conſcience, and terrours in the heart; the leaſt wound in the heart is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the pain of the heart is deadly, it does not admit of <hi>ſplutio continui,</hi> as Phyſicians ſay, but there may be a Fire and a Hell kindled in the Conſcience, that little affects the heart; though a hypocrite out-ſtrip thee in terrours and flaſhes of joy, yet if thou has win to the Bridge that leads over the deep Water of legal Humiliation, it's Evangelick Sincerity, if in thy mourning thou has looked on him whom thou haſt pierced, it's Evangelick Humiliation.</p>
            <p>There is another caſe occurs; By what rules may a ſinner know that he is humbled for ſin, that he may go and apply the Covenant? How ſhall we know that even Evangelically our Humiliation is ſuch, as we may go and make uſe of the Covenant? We ſay not (for anſwer) that all ſinners, and all humbled ſinners, may ay run to the Covenant; that great <hi>Antinomian Criſp,</hi> he makes uſe of that word, a ſinner reeking in ſin, immediatly after they have committed the ſin, ſays he, they have no more ado, but go to the Covenant; but we ſay, they muſt repent, and be humbled, and believe, and go to the Covenant: we ſay, that thy legal Humiliation not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:43047:184"/>dew, there are others they will get it like a deludge. But <hi>2ly.</hi> As Gods way is diverſe in bringing to the Covenant, ſo there are three qualifications of humiliation for guilt, that whatever perſon hath them, they may in that place warrantably go, and rely on the Covenant, and apply it 1. When the ſoul comes to be humbled for that which is worſt in ſin; the worſt is not that it is damning, but that it is diſhonourable to God; and when the ſinner comes to be humbled for guilt, as it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to God, as having in it rebellion againſt his Law, ingratitude againſt his mercy, and contempt againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, when a ſoul is grieved for that which is worſt in ſin, in that caſe they may apply the Covenant, and rely on it, and have ſome ſweet grounds of the accompliſhment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant. <hi>2ly.</hi> When the ſoul is ſo humbled, as it's content to take the Covenant on the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without the alteration of any of the terms, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take him for a Saviour, and as content to take him for a King: Oftentimes we would alter ſomething in the order and method, and nature of the Covenant; but when we are content to take it for good and ill, for duties and priviledges, when the ſoul is ſo humbled, as it's content to take Chriſt for King, Prieſt, and Prophet, and to take him in all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of it as it ſtands; in that caſe the Soul is Evangelically humbled, and may plead the Covenant, and rely upon it. <hi>3ly.</hi> When the ſoul is humbled not only for the guilt of ſin, but for the blot of ſin, that it hath defiled; a believer in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, is like a man that will not touch a Coal, ſome will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

I tremble to ſee many dying perſons pleading the Covenant, and hoping for mercy, yea, even ſome in old age dying, and pleading to the Covenant, and knows neither what Legal nor Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick humiliation means; take heed any of you that viſits the ſick, that ye ſend them not in to Hell reeking, and flattering them with a deluſion in their right hand.</p>
            <p>There are ſome plead the Covenant too ſlowly, they think they are never right but when they are under terrours, and they cannot long enough travel under them, they are ay wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Water that goes over their head, and goes not about to the Bridge, It's righteous with God to give them their fill of terrours, and to do with them as he did with that great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mr. <hi>Lawer,</hi> who prayed unto the Lord that he would give him terrours, that he might know what they were, and the Lord gave him his fill of them, ſo that he went to the Grave, forbidding all men to pray for terrours.</p>
            <p>I will only exhort one another of you, that are now and then put to this, <hi>My houſe is not ſo with God,</hi> to take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; be not driven from it, and I will give you three Rules in pleading of it. 1. Plead the Covenant in the right method of it, remember ye of the ordering of the Covenant, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſes are to be taken before the Conditional, the Promiſes of the firſt Graces before the ſecond; plead the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the right method of it, if ye cry Lord, give me pardon, and has never gotten Repentance; if ye cry Lord, give me peace, and has never gotten pardon, ye pray out of the order of the Covenant; the order of the Covenant is, we muſt firſt repent, and then have pardon, we muſt firſt have pardon, and then have peace; thou that preſſes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant out of the order of it, thou art not praying in Faith, thou art tempting God, and bidding him overturn the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that is well ordered in reference to thy particular caſe; and if thou haſt never had the Promiſes of the firſt Graces, thou wilt not get the promiſes of the ſecond, thou wilt never have peace, until thou get a new heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. <hi>2ly.</hi> I will give you this Direction, know, that though there be not a proportional ſorrow to your guilt, nay though
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:43047:185"/>poſſibly ye can hardly diſcern it Evangelically, yet plead the Covenant; Some all their terrors, or the great flood of them, are in the beginning of their Converſion; others get them in the progreſs of Sanctification, many have their praying, believing, and reading, mingled in with terrors; if thou has a ſound work the day, thou art baptized, it's well, or if he give thee thy terrors by drops, after thou haſt cloſed the Covenant, it's well. 3. I exhort thee in pleading the Covenant, if thou has been humbled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and relyed on it, and haſt gotten any clearing of thy Intereſt in it, make not a dayly diſpute of thy Intereſt to it; it were good, when we have gotten any clearing of our Intereſt, to lay down principles, that we would walk by, in the whole courſe of our life; it's ſad to have God ay renewing our Evidences every day, or then we will not only diſpute them, but deny them.</p>

            <p>And here I would have you notice three things remarkable. 1. Several times the Promiſe, it ſeems to point a very direct croſs way to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God; the Providence will ſeem to be walking toward the eaſt, as it were, when the Promiſe is walking to the Airt direct contrary; ſo ye will find, if ye take the ſtrain of the Bible; who would think but the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should have proſperity? should have anſwers of Prayer? have many days of communion and fellowship that they want? who would think, but that the wicked should be broken? having all the Plagues written in the Bible coming on them? yet take this Bible, both in the Promiſſory or Threatning Part of it, and ye shall find the Promiſes, as it were quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Providence; <hi>Aſaph</hi> is corrected every morning, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 2. Notice this, that it is a very ordinary thing for Satan in his Temptations, to bring Providences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Promiſe, the Lord will give him a Commiſſion ſometimes, as he did to <hi>Job,</hi> take his cattel, take his sheep, and then take his Children, and then he put his body in his power, excepting only his Life; and when he hath done all this, he brings in his friends to call him an Hypocrite, and brings his Wife, to bid him curſe God and die; never gets the Adverſary more advantage, than when our back is at the wall, under the croſs, and then he puts us to doubt of the Promlſe; Temptations never have ſuch a back, as when they are backed with Affliction; ſo that as the Providence and the Promiſe ſeem contrary, the Politick Adverſary will take advantage of the Providence, and put the Soul to doubt of the Promiſe. 3. Note this, that a Believer, though he be called to live a life of Faith, and to be endeavouring it, yet he is ſtrongly inclined to live a life of Senſe; there is nothing more natural to us than this, of all the difflcult things that <hi>Luther</hi> found, he profeſſed it to be one of the greateſt, to truſt in a correcting God, and believe in a withdrawing God; men have ſuch an inclination to live by ſenſe, that the generality of the world, for a long time were enemies to Chriſtians, on this ground, O! ſay they, they call us to believe in a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord, and he that was not able to ſave himſelf, is he able to ſave his People? ſo, ſince Providences go contrair to the Promiſe, and ſince Satan will argue from providences againſt the promiſe, and find his advantage in our nature, to be inclining us ſo ſtrongly to live by Senſe, and not by Faith, no wonder it be a conſiderable Objection againſt the Covenant, that he makes it not to grow. This Truth, if it were beat out, might be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful; I believe many has found it, that God's Providence, and his Dealings with the Church, hath inclined you to the opinion of Ranters, that they are half Fools, that will credit one Promiſe, when they find all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences rolling againſt that Promiſe; and how many times are ye put to it in your particular caſe, like <hi>Rebecca,</hi> ye have the Twins ſtruggling within you, why am I thus, ſays she, under ſuch terrors and afflictions? there lyes the great exception ye have againſt the Promiſe, and the Providence, that he makes it not to grow; Learn to guard againſt this, I will offer you three or four remarkable things, that may contribute to guard againſt it. 1. Conſider, Chriſtian, the chiefeſt Believer may have no conſiderable providence, when the providence is made an argument againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>he should bear a Son, but she hath a dead womb; another time he is told by the Angel, that he muſt take his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and offer him up in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, even though the promiſe ran, <hi>in</hi> Iſaac <hi>shall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed;</hi> might he not well argue, will all the nations of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a burnt-ſacrifice? He muſt take off his Head, and offer him upon an Altar, but he conſidered not the deadneſs of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb, and ſtaggered not at the Promiſe, but gave glory to God, and believed, that out of the Ashes of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he could accomplish his Promiſe. So that God's choiſeſt friends have not had conſiderable Providences, when they were made uſe of, as Arguments againſt the Promiſe. 2. Take notice of this, That all Providences work together in their ultimat end, for accomplishing the Promiſes; it's true, He whoſe way is in the Sea, and whoſe paths are in the deep waters, His motion is like the wheels of a Clock, any that would look on them, and ſee them move croſs one to another; would wonder whereto they tended, but all theſe motions tend, to make the Clock ſtrike when the hour comes; all the Providences of God do tend to the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Promiſe, it's true, we ſee not their tendency; but they all tend, and in end, they all reſolve in the accomplishment of the Promiſe. 3. Ye would notice this, that Providences are not a Believers Rule; I confeſs there is a ſweet uſe of Providences, he that obſerves them, will underſtand much of the loving kindneſs of the Lord; there are ſome godly men of this Church, now in glory, there was nothing could befall them, but they were conſtantly put to turn it over, even the ſmalleſt of things, that they might read out ſome meſſage from God under it, and yet never took them them to Providences for their Rule, they took them to the Word, and to to the Promiſes for their Rule; Providences are not our Rule, it's the Word of God, and the Promiſe, that we are to walk by; ſo that, be the Providence what it will, a Believer hath a Key to open it with, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it by; therefore be the providence what it will, they need not ſtagger at the promiſe. 4. I will add this, that ſeldom is a Chriſtian tryſted with ſuch Providences, but in one thing or another, they have the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe, there is either one promiſe or another accomplished; if God deny one, he is making out another, and the accomplishment of one promiſe, may be a ſeal of the whole Covenant; I will ſay no more of this Truth, only guard againſt it, that Providences put not you to ſtagger at the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> There is another word lying in this, <hi>Although he make it not to grow,</hi> and it's this. <hi>That however God delay in his providence to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish promiſes, yet a Believer hath the promiſe in the ſeed, or in the bud;</hi> The word ſignifies to ſpring, though he make it not to ſpring, a metaphor taken from a Plant, that is not yet above the ground, though Believers find not the Promiſes ſpringing and growing, yet they have them in the Seed. There is a three-fold Seed, that accomplishes conſolation to Believers, in their greateſt difficulties. 1. The Seed they are looking for, is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpoſe of God; <hi>I know what thoughts I have to you ward, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end;</hi> The Lord is ſending them to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to encourage them, he ſays, I know what thoughts I have to you ward, my hand is carrying you to <hi>Babylon,</hi> but my heart is to give you an expected end; the mercy that they look for, though it grow not, yet they have it in the Decree and Thought of God. 2. Things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, though they grow not, yet they are often in the Seed of Secondary Cauſes, and the Tendency of them may bea Seed, out of which they may grow; the Lord ſometimes may remove his enemies, and put diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43047:187"/>them, and put them under Challenges, and yet they may be the See<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of an out-gate to the Church, readily he will tryſt them with ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, as in the beginning, none will ſee whereto they tend, and yet in the end, he will bring out of them the accomplishment of the Promiſe. 3. He will bring out the Seed out of the Providences themſelves, the days will come, when holineſs shall be written on Horſes Bells, and the Wolf and the Lamb shall ly down together, and none of them shall hurt other; and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the Child is unborn, that shall ſee theſe days of the mercies made over by the Covenant; and though they appear not, yet a Believer hath them in the Seed, they are like Seed ſown in the Ground, and a Spring shall come: and here is a ſpecial encouragement, a Believer may have doubting and trembling thoughts, about the caſe of the Church, and aſtonishment whiles about thy own caſe, even for what appears above ground, but the Seed of Deliverance to the Church, and other mercies to thee, are in the Promiſe; wait till the Spring come, and the Winter be over and gone, and thou shalt ſee them ſprouting, as ever thou ſaw a Plant ſpring and ſprout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the Spring time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine</hi> 3. Thirdly Obſerve, <hi>That even when Providences make againſt the Promiſe, yet a Believer should rely on the promiſe, and on the Covenant, though he make it to grow; yet it's ſure. it's ordered, it's all thy ſalvation, and all thy deſire, it's everlaſting.</hi> So this point falls in natively here, and there are three things I will ſpeak a little to her. 1. In what caſes a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever should rely on the Promiſe, when providences make againſt it. 2. On what grounds they should rely on the Promiſes. And 3. I shall apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In what caſes a Believer should rely on the Promiſe, when the Providence makes againſt it? And here I will inſtance four or five Caſes. 1, When we pray, and God delays to anſwer; we ought then to take our anſwer out of the Promiſe; ordinarily we pray in the day time, and in the night time we are not heard, our throat may be hoarſe with crying, and our eyes fail with looking up, and get no anſwer; in that caſe, a Chriſtian is to take his anſwer out of the Promiſe, the Promiſe ought to ſupply, and make up the room of the Providence, the more patiently one wait for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in prayer, and ly ſtill until the Promiſe come, and take the Bible, and the Promiſe, and feed on it, until the Providence come, the more peace when it is come. 2. Though Providences ſeem contrary to the Promiſe, yet we are to rely on the Covenant, and that even when God is writing bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things againſt his Church; ſeveral times his Providences are plucking up that which hath been planted, and pulling down that which hath been built, he may bring a Vine out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bring a wild Boar out of the Forreſt to trample it down; in that caſe they are to take them to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they should credit and rejoyce in the promiſe, and take up the Pſalm Book, and ſing upon the credit of the Promiſe. A third Caſe wherein they are to hazard on the Promiſe, when Providences ſeem contrary to them, is, when God withdraws and hides, and readily becomes a terror; ſeveral times he will do ſo, do ye not find him do ſo? Though he be your hope, will he not ſometimes be your terror? any that read the Bible may think, if I be redeemed, how is he my terror? Thou hoſt forgotten the promiſe, and he hath put thee to read over forgotten Promiſes, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to put thee to take the Promiſe, until the Providence come. 4. In all c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſes of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Lord takes away a Husband, a Wife, a Child, and may be takes away Proſperity, and gives thee Adverſity; in that caſe, he will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Providence from thee, and have thee to feed on the Promiſe; there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s no caſe, wherein the Providence ſeems hardly comparable with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43047:187"/>but he would have thee to feed on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Promiſe, and take the Promiſe in the place of the Providence.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I shall shew you on what grounds, when God makes not the thing to grow, and we can ſee nothing above the ground in the Providence, that we should then eſpecially adhere to the Covenant. 1. Let Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be what they will, all the Seals remain at the Covenant; it is Sealed with the Oath of God, with the Blood of his Son. thou haſt gotten it Sealed with the Seal of the Spirit of Promiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. Let Providences be what they will, God hath not taken away one Seal from the Covenant; grant it be ill with the Church of God, grant thou gets no anſwer of Prayer, grant thou be haunted with Terrors, and outwardly with Croſſes, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Covenant is ſure; he hath not broken off one Seal from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it ſtands as at the beginning, it's ſure, and the Oath of God is at it, the Blood of God is at it, and may we not then firmly rely on the Covenant? 2. I would have you notice, That feveral times God tryſts Chriſtians with croſs Providences, purpoſely to make them rely on the Covenant; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the deſign of Croſſes is, to try if Faith will take a naked promiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of God, and rejoyce in it; ſome afflictions come for chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sin, but ſome comes meerly for tryal, <hi>Job</hi>'s Afflictions were of this nature, it's true, he was a ſinner, yet all that came on him, was not for ſin, but for tryal, the Lord bids Satan examine him, <hi>Haſt thou conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my ſervant Job?</hi> and how well can he fay his Leſſon, this was deſigned for tryal, to ſee if he would keep by God, and to the Covenant, in the midſt of all that tryal; therefore, like a Maſter triumphing in his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Lord tells Satan, he ſtill retains his integrity, though thou haſt moved me againſt him without cauſe; in the midſt of all his tryals, he will not take with it, that he was a Hypocrite, as there are ſome, they cannot be perſwaded but they are Hypocrites, ſo there are ſome, none can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that they are Hypocrites, I will maintain my integrity before him, that is, I will maintain it to his face. 3. Take notice of this, that hardly is there any thing more honourable to God, than to rely on a Promiſe, when all Providences ſeems againſt it; this gives glory to God eminently; but when we, like <hi>Thomas,</hi> will not believe except we ſee, and put in our hand in the print of the nails: it's dishonourable to him, <hi>James</hi> 2.23. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> and he was called, <hi>the friend of God: Abraham</hi> could not kyth himſelf more God's friend, in any thing he could do, than in believing, that out of the Ashes of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was able to fulfil his Promiſe; and that though <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb was dead, yet he ſtaggered not at the Promiſe: There is nothing more honourable to God, than when we can truſt him againſt ſenſe, and as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in hope againſt hope. 4. Conſider this, That relying on the Promiſe againſt Providence, as it's honourable to God, and excellently improven, when we are tryed, and all the Seals appended and continue firm at this Covenant; So <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider, that Providences they are all to be examined by the Promiſes, but the Promiſes are not to be examined by the Providences; if ye would know a Providence, if it be an Act of Mercy, or an Act of Wrath, ye are to try it by the Word, ye are not to try the Promiſes by the Providences, the Promiſe is the Touch-ſtone, by which the Providences is to be tryed; on this account it comes to paſs, one may have a Rod in Mercy, and another in Wrath; and one may have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he practice of this in two Caſes, Firſt, in reference to the deſolate Caſe of the Church of God; O! but Providences look unlike the Promiſes, in the Caſe of the Church, what? shall we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſmall handful are ſo Toſſed, ſo Divided and Rent, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſo great, ſo High and Potent, shall we therefore caſt away Hope, but that he yet will ariſe, and revive his Work in the midſt of the days? No, ſo long as there ſtands a Bible, and ſo well ordered a Covenant, and Promiſes, and in theſe Promiſes <hi>Scotlands</hi> Peace is concerned; therefore, whatever Providences ſeem contrair to the Promiſe, caſt not away Hope, take the Promiſes, and read them, and apply them to the Churches Caſe; and feed on them, until the Providence come. 2. Improve it, any of you that is Clogged in Spirit, Alas! ye know not what to ſay of your Caſe; Guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Terror ſtares you in the Face; but is there any Seal taken from the Covenant? Is it not Ratified by the Blood of his Son? and want ye ground of Hope, ſo long as it is ſo well Ratified; and though it grow not ſo well as to the outward man, yet ye have a Rich Charter, be not driven by Croſſes from the Covenant; learn this, that ye would now believe, and credit the Covenant, and Promiſes, <hi>Although he make it not to grow.</hi>

            <p>Now from all that hath been ſaid on this Verſe, I will only ſay theſe three things. 1. I shall give you a brief account of what led me to this Text, I found the Refuge of the Soul in Diſtreſs, to ly in the Covenant; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the Gates of Death, when other Refuges failed them, they found no other; I my ſelf found no other for my Soul, but to run to the Covenant in the Latitude and Freedom of it, and ſince it appeared ſo ſweet, it was ſomewhat troubleſome to me; that I had not handled it ere now; but in handling of it, I gave an account of the nature of <hi>David's</hi> Security, and then I handled perſonal Covenanting, <hi>The Lord hath made with me;</hi> ye heard ten or twelve Sermons on that head. And 2. I came and handled the Properties of the Covenant, that it was <hi>Everlaſting, Sure,</hi> and <hi>Ordered in all things,</hi> where ye heard ſeveral things on the Order and Method of the Covenant, that a Chriſtian should keep, to keep him from deluſion, and falſe Peace in the Covenant. 3. I came to the Superſtructures, <hi>This is all my Salvation, and all my Deſire;</hi> I shewed you that that man that will plead for Mercy and Grace, and hath no right to the Covenant, he hath no ground to plead them, more than the Devils have, for they know that he is Merciful and Gracious, the thing that makes the Devils have no claim to his Mercy and Grace is, becauſe they have no claim to his Covenant. I have now ſtudied the Covenant, and laid it out before you, as the great Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sanctification and Conſolation, and as the great Charter of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Now I ſay, having gone through all theſe, I would put all of you, that has been hearing theſe Sermons, to theſe three Queſtions. 1. I would inquire, What more light have ye of the Covenant than before? <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his Covenant, Pſal.</hi> 25. What know ye more of the Covenant than before? of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it? nay, of perſonal Covenanting? of the Properties of it? of the Sweetneſs and Conſolation that comes from it? if ye have no more light, and knowledge of it than before, the Lord, and the Stones and Timber of this Houſe, shall be a witneſs againſt you in the day of reckoning, that this Covenant hath been holden out to you, in the Latitude and Freedom of it, and among all things that ye have heard, it may be a ſufficient witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, when ye meet your Judge in the Valley of Deciſion. But 2. Another Queſtion is, Whether hath what ye have heard from the Covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap> enter in a Perſonal Covenant with him? I have ſeveral days ſent
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:43047:188"/>you home, beſeeching you to enter in a Perſonal Covenant with him, and I have given you Doctrines and Helps how to do it, and hath the wind blown it all away, and ye have done nothing? have ye not Covenanted againſt the corruptions that the heart inclined you moſt unto? have ye Covenanted to accept of his Son on the Terms of the Covenant? I cloſe this Text with wondring how ye have gotten it ſit out, if ye have not yet ſet about it, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you in my Maſters Name, in the cloſe of this Text, that now ye would Indenture, and make a Perſonal Covenant with him, Go and Indenture and Covenant with him, otherwiſe the Lord, and this place of Scripture, shall one day joyn together, and ſay, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, I know you not.</hi> 3. A third Queſtion is, Ye that have been hearers of me, whether now, when ye have heard me all out, ye have heard Chriſt commended, ye heard the Contract was well drawn, ye heard what Grounds of Salvation, and what Satisfaction to Deſires, is in the Covenant, and have ye not heard, how a perſon may plead the Covenant, under many challenges? Now, whether or not are ye content this day, to accept Chriſt on the Terms offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after ye have heard all I could ſay, or read about it, are ye content to accept him; ſay ye, Amen, even ſo I take Him? are ye content on theſe very Terms holden out in the Covenant, to accept of him? I teſtifie unto you, that at the Gates of Death, neither ye, nor I, will know of another way for refuge from his wrath, but to run to this Covenant; are ye ſaying now, even ſo I take him, as he is offered in the Covenant? then have him, and his Fathers bleſſing with him, a Bargain be it, there wanted nothing twenty years ſince, but thy conſent, the only thing that delayed the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was thy conſent; and if in the cloſe of this day, this be thy Note thou haſt gotten, even ſo I take him, according to the Tenor of that Covenant, this shall be the place of Scripture, that thou shall bleſs the day, that ever thou heard it opened to thee, that thou was content to accept and imbrace this Chriſt, on the credit of the Promiſe, thou may take him, and hazard all thy life on him.</p>
